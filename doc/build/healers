Healers
*******

Healers are really very easy.  There are only two basic functions
which are differant than a basic Sentient.
 
int SetCharge(int);
Example:  SetCharge(10); 

    Sets the charge rate for healing.
    The rates are:
    Healing, per point == charge / 5
    Restoring Limbs    == Charge * 5
    Ressurection       == Charge * 50
 
string SetLocalCurrency(string);
Example:  SetLocalCurrency("imperials");

    Sets the local currency.
 
 
  PLEASE NOTE:  The charge is given as a normal number.
     This means that if you set a charge of 10, it will cost:
     50 of whatever coin you specify to restore a limb.
     This is NOT modified by the economy daemon.  Please remember
     that when setting prices.
