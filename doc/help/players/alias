    ALIAS

  <alias>, <alias aliasname command>, <alias aliasname command $*>

  Lets you nickname commands rather than typing them out each time.
  <alias> displays your aliases, <alias aliasname command> creates a new
  alias, and <alias aliasname command $*> is when you have a command that
  needs a separate variable, like a target. An example would be
  <cm cast missile on $*> so when you use it you will only need to type
  <cm groundhog> or whatnot.

  To remove an alias you no longer want, type <alias aliasname>
