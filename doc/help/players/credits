  Haven is based on two versions of the Nightmare Mudlib, released as 
  "Dead Souls" and "Nightmare-IVr2", created in whole or part by George 
  Reese (Descartes@Nightmare).  It runs using the MudOS driver, which 
  was created by Beek@Lima Bean and others. More information on the 
                 original mudlib and driver can be found at 
                          http://www.imaginary.com

               Haven was made possible through countless 
                 hours of coding by my dedicated staff.
