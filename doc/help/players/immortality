  If you came to Haven seeking a position as an Immortal, GOOD!
  However, in order to be considered for a position as an Angel,
  you must first demonstrate your familiarity with the world of
  Kailie and tell us what you want to do here, et cetera.  The
  first step is learning a lot about Kailie and roleplaying--
  many of the questions focus on those aspects.
  
  Once you feel ready, type <angeltest>.  This command leads you
  through a series of questions about yourself and about Haven.
  Make sure that you are in a safe place before you begin!  You can
  type "quit" at any time.  Your answers are saved to a file, and
  you can only take the test once, after which the immortals will
  review it and return to you with a conclusion.  If you made a
  mistake or had to quit halfway through, talk to a sage+ about
  taking it again.
  
  Thank you for your interest.  We hope to be able to welcome you into
  the immortal team soon!
