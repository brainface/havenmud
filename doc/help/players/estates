Estates on Haven are the ultimate status symbol.  You can purchase an estate,
which is a private home, from the mayor of your city.  You may only own one
estate in any given town.

These estates are a privilege for advanced players and are subject to being
removed from the game if they are abused.

GETTING STARTED

Go up to your mayor.  Ask him for an estate.  He'll charge you a pile of money
(approximately 100,000 imperials).  You'll get a box.  Take the box to a nice
spot in your town (not indoors).  Look at the box.

You'll build a nice, shiny estate!  And you'll get a key.  This key is the 
master key for your estate.  Try hard not to lose it.

SETTING UP

Use the 'eset' command to set the <short> description (the blue words) and the
<description> (the rest of the words).  THESE DESCRIPTIONS ARE IN-CHARACTER.
Making a dumb description will get your estate burned down. 

  ---->  THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE LOGGED AND DUUK WILL BE CHECKING THEM.
  
OH NOES! I LOST MY KEY!

Have no fear.  Go to your mayor and ask him for a new one.
