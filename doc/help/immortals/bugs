Bug Logging on Haven is relatively simple.

Series of events:
  1) User creates bug using `bug` command
  2) Bug file is written to /log/bugs
  3) A Script on the server watches /log/bugs for
     new files and processes them.
  4) Processing includes reading the file and
     creating a corresponding ticket at
     https://bugs.havenmud.com/scp
  5) Once processed and ticket created 
     successfully, the file in /log/bugs is
     moved to /log/bugs/processed for history
     and viewability on the server.

 So, tl;dr --> https://bugs.havenmud.com/scp
