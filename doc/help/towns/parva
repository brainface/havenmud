Game Notes      : The Port of Parva is located to the south of
                  the Estergrym Mountains on the Northeastern
                  edge of the HavenWood forest. The town is very
                  dirty and its inhabitants often reflect this.
                  They are known to be very brutish and rude and
                  have little respect for much of anything. They 
                  are typically of the criminal element, and as such
                  they make visitors to the city very weary of their
                  belongings. The exceptions to this rule are usually 
                  found among the Damhair followers, who are more
                  concerned with the nature of the Ocean and the
                  Drowned God's mood.            
            
Game History    : Parva has a history for being a very lawless town.
                  The very nature of the city is that of refuge and
                  often times criminals in other parts of the world
                  will flee to Parva in an attempt to blend in with
                  the criminal population.
