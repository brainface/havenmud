Game Notes      : Nestled somewhere within the barren
                  Yozrath desert, the city of Yozrath
                  has made a reputation for themselves
                  as devout followers of Kylin. However,
                  their version of Kylin is slightly
                  different than that of the majority
                  of followers. They Yozrathi's believe
                  in strict and swift punishment for
                  even minor transgressions and will not
                  be swayed in their beliefs.
