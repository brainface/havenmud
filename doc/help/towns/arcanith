Game Notes      : The Ruins of Arcanith are all that remains of the
                  once famous City of Light. The current residents
                  are little more than squatters in what was once
                  an incredibly magical area. Given the primitive
                  nature of kobolds, they have taken to simply
                  dwelling in the buildings that remain with no
                  intent of rebuilding the city to its former glory.
                  But the residual magic in the area has influenced
                  the Kobolds in such a way that they have taken on
                  the worship of magic under the Magildan religion.
                  While they adhere to a slightly more primitive practice
                  of the faith the fundamentals are the same only with
                  a concentration on the wonder and awe of magic and not
                  the scholarly pursuit one might find in Jidoor.

Game History    : Unfortunately, not much is known about Arcanith as
                  it once was. For nearly the entire span of written
                  history it has been in ruins. Where the ruins now lie,
                  however, there was once a great city of magic and learning
                  known as the City of Light that has long since faded into
                  antiquity with a history that only the most dedicated of
                  scholars study.
