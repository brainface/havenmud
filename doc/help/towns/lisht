Game Notes      : On the far away southern continent

                  inhabited by two peoples: the Gnolls
                  and a lost tribe of elves. The Gnolls
                  have subjugated the elves and use
                  them as slave labor. The elves
                  have learned to deal with the ever
                  present harassment and abuse from
                  the ruling gnoll body and have taken
                  to a deep reverence for their Lord.
