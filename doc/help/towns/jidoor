Game Notes      : As the seat of the Magildan faith,
                  Jidoor emphasises magical studies.
                  Citizens begin training at an early
                  age and those who are unable to
                  advance among the mages are often
                  shunned and become outcasts of the
                  city. The Jidoorian affinity for magic
                  is unparalleled in Kailie.

Game History    : Jidoor is home to the Jidoor Library,
                  which houses one of the greatest
                  collections known to Kailie. For years
                  it has been a virtual Mecca for mages
                  from all over Kailie.
