   
   Lamrani are tall and very slim creatures with pale 
   white skin. They tend to reach about six to seven 
   feet at maturity.  They are physically very fragile 
   and weak but they are, without question, the perfect 
   race of mages.  Rumor has it that their mental 
   capability has granted them an awesome  ability; 
   the power to stop magical damage from harming them.
   Another key feature of Lamrani is that they do not 
   walk.  Instead, they float about six inches from the 
   ground, entirely by the power of their mind.
