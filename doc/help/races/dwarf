   
   Dwarves are the short and stocky underground
   dwellers hailing from Glimmerdin. They strongly
   resemble humans in all manners except for their
   stature and durability. Years of being a mining
   people have hardened them into very tough and
   stubborn people. This obdurate nature makes them
   very good friends and devout followers of the
   Kylin faith. Despite their small size, many of
   the less civilized races have learned to fear
   the approach of dwarves as a sign of a swift
   and painful execution.
