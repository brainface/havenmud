   
   Created through the miscegenation of humans and 
   elves, half-elves often find themselves being
   treated as second rate. Typically both races
   find that because of their half-breed status
   they are not entitled to full integration
   into the society. As such, many half-elves
   find their lives full of loneliness. Physically,
   they look like humans with olive skin and slightly
   pointed ears. Because of their unique parentage,
   half-elves can be considered the best of both
   worlds. They are not as smart as full bred elves
   but they are stronger and luckier thanks to
   their human half.
