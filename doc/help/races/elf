   
   Haven Town:
   
   The elves from the main land are the chosen race
   of their Lord, Duuk. When the world was young,
   the first sentient beings to be placed upon
   Kailie were the elves. With this in mind, the 
   elves are very arrogant and flash an air of
   superiority towards other races. With very
   few exceptions, they follow the Kylin faith
   very strictly and adore their Lord as one
   would adore their own father.
   
   Lisht:
   
   On the southern continent of Xandria, another
   breed of elves live in the city of Lisht. For
   years they have been abused and enslaved by the
   Gnolls and as such, they have learned to be
   extremely resourceful and persevering. They
   follow the faith of Anteky which heralds Duuk
   as the only God. Rumors of a resistance to the
   ruling Xandrian monarchy float around various
   circles of elven society in Lisht, but little
   open resistance is seen for fear of great
   retribution by the Pharaoh.
