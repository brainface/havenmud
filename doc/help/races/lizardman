   The lizardmen of the Gwonish Swamp are large bipedal
   lizards. Like other lizards, they are covered in 
   scales which are green and have a tail and snout.
   Their society is of a tribalistic nature and they
   tend to be very savage in their dealings with 
   trespassers on their swampland. Their strange
   appearance and aggressive nature has lead the
   other races to look upon the lizardmen with a mix of
   fear and loathing. The proximity of their swampland
   home to that of the Halfling village of Lloryk has
   led the two races to despise the existence of each
   other.
