   Small, green, ugly, stupid, cowardly. Goblins are
   the embodiment of comic bravado. The key to 
   understanding the goblin way of life is found in
   the following phrase: "talk big and run fast."
   They tend to speak before they think and often
   hunt in packs because of this. They are very
   primitive in their development and tend to live
   their lives very quickly as they usually find
   a quick end from some foolish act of trickery
   or malice.
