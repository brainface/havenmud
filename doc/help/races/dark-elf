  the light of their creator and forced to live underground.

  ROLEPLAY
  
  Dark-elves are generally Soirin in faith and are the truest
  example of that faith.  Greed, lust, desire, and self-interest
  rule their universe. The monarchy of the dark-elves is well
  known for short, tyrannical reigns most often ended by
  assassination.  Dark-elves should be played with the utmost
  desire and motivation.  If it's a deadly sin, the dark-elves
  are not only inspired by it but probably have a story bettering
  it.  Lust, greed, envy, sloth, and gluttony are only a short
  weekend for a dark-elf.
