   The unholy union of a human and orc led to the
   atrocious creation of the half-orc breed. These
   unfortunate creatures look much like humans with
   exception to their horrendous pig-like ears and
   grotesque deformation of a body too big for it's
   frame. As for their place in society, these
   creatures tend to be shunned by both orcs and
   humans alike. Orcs typically feel that the half
   breeds are not as valuable as a warrior whereas
   humans despise the sight of them as pure
   abominations. The life of a half-orc is very
   difficult due to these ostracizations from both
   sides of their heritage as well as their horrible
   appearance that strikes fear into all the other
   races which typically would rather just 
   exterminate them than help or console them for 
   their great misfortune.
