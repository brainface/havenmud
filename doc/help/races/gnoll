   
   Gnolls are best described as a race of humanoid
   dogs. They have a thin fur coat covering their
   bodies and a long canine snout. For years they
   have subjugated the elves on the continent
   of Xandria and because of this, they are a very
   arrogant and rude people. They are fierce followers
   of the Enniae faith which embraces a philosophy
   of 'Might makes right' which makes them very
   unforgiving of mistakes and often hostile towards
   those they feel might become threats.
