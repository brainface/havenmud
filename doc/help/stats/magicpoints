   Magic Points   (mp)

   Magic points are your character's current spell-casting ability.  It is
   the current amount of magic that your character can contain and use.  
   Once your magic points hit zero, your character will be unable to cast
   spells until some are recovered.  Magic points are directly affected by
   your character's intelligence and are recovered over time.  Magic points
   may be recovered quicker by laying down or sitting.

   (NB: Characters who join a faith- or nature-based class will have
   their mps recalculated off of their wisdom stat, rather than their
   intelligence stat, to reflect the orientation of their classes.)
