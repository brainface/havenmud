   Coordination

   This is how well your character handles complicated activites.  Anyone
   that is coordinated has little problems juggling or performing other
   well timed activities.  This affects how well your character fights with
   multiple weapons, as well as how well you handle being drunk.  This
   is a useful ability for anyone who fights, as well as for drunkards.
