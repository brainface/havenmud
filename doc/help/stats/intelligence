   Intelligence

   This is your character's raw brain power.  Characters with high intelligence
   have little problems with computations and understand things more easily
   than those with low intelligence scores.  Intelligence directly affects
   your character's magic points, how quickly they learn languages and the
   effectiveness of their spells.  Intelligence is very important for 
   anyone considering a spell casting class.

   (NB: Characters who join a faith- or nature-based class will have
   their mps recalculated off of their wisdom stat, rather than their
   intelligence stat, to reflect the orientation of their classes.)
