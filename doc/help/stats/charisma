   Charisma

   Charisma is the overall attractiveness and persuasive ability of your
   character.  Characters with a high charisma have an easier time bargining
   with merchants, as well as convincing monsters not to attack them.
   Not suprisingly, any character considering becoming a merchant should 
   have a high charisma.

   (Note that charisma only affects actions of NPC's and has nothing
    to do with the reactions of players.)
