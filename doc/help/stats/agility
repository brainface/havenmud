   Agility

   This is a measure of how lithe and accurate your character is.  Anybody
   with a high agility has little problems palming coins as well as squeezing
   through tight spots.  Agility directly affects how accurate your character
   is in combat.  Anyone considering thievery, or fighting with style should
   have a high agility.
