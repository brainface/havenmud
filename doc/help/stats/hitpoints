   Hit Points   (hp)

   Hit Points are how much damage your character can take before dying.
   It is a combination of the will to live and physical toughness.  In either
   case, once your hp reaches zero, you're dead. Hit points are directly
   affected by your character's durability.  Hit points are recovered over
   time, and through the healing skill and spells.  They may be recovered
   quicker by laying or sitting down.
