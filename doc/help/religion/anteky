  Anteky is a "minor" religion of Kailie practiced almost exclusively
  by the downtrodden elven slaves of the Xandrian Kingdom. Anteky is
  an older, more basic form of Kylin with an interesting basis. The 
  Anteky follower believes that there is no god but Duuk, and thus they
  are the world of Kailie's only monotheistic religion.
  
  Followers of Anteky believe that the Lord will deliver them from their
  bondage in Xandria and will redeem them through a promised land. Their
  current status borders on "passive waiting" and "active resistance", 
  which the Xandrian Kingdom is likely to crush brutally.
  
  Followers of Anteky will not shy from bloodshed, but are essentially
  a "good" people, disliking unneccessary violence and disdaining those
  whose do not maintain a balance in their lives. Anteky followers believe
  that good works, not merely good words, allow people to pass into the
  afterlife with a perfect slate and thus reside on the Lord's plane of
  existance for all eternity.
  
  Followers of Anteky pray only to the Lord, though they rarely refer to
  him as "Duuk" or "Duuktsaryth", feeling that to be too personal and
  disrespectful to their god.
