  Eclat is one of the major faiths of Kailie.
  Presided over by Amelia, this faith is the strongest
  force of goodness in the land.  The beliefs of the
  Eclat are simple, all the world should live in peace
  and harmony without fear of violence or aggression.

  The Eclat follower will be someone that makes every
  attempt to bring light, health, and cheer into the
  lives of the sentient races of Kailie. Though the
  Eclat are not above violence in a good and well
  justified cause, they are not by nature warriors or
  killers of great reknown.  Instead they are known as
  the bringers of a better world, where all the races
  have their say without intimidation or death touching
  before its time.

  To the Eclat, charity and generosity are harbingers of
  happiness and goodness onto others.  After all, a man
  dying of starvation is not one who is experiencing the
  joy of living to the fullest.  The Eclat strive to bring
  joy and fun into the lives of all they meet, and are known
  throughout Kailie as people welcome in all lands in which
  people can meet for friendly gatherings and enjoy life.

  The demi-gods of Eclat are patrons of Song, Music, Friendship,
  Fellowship, and Mercy. Prayers should be addressed to Amelia,
  often referred to as the Lady of Mercy.
