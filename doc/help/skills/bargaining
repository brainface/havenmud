You can haggle with merchants for better deals and sell for
higher profit. A skilled bargainer can sell goods for a 
much greater price. Some merchants are harder to bargain 
with that others, though! This skill is automatically in

items as well as debate with others to test their mettle.

Many trainers teach bargaining.
