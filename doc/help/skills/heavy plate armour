HEAVY PLATE ARMOUR
Type: Passive Combat
Commands: compare

You are skilled in defending yourself while wearing heavy 
plate armour. Your limbs protected by heavy plate take 
less damage from attacks and damaged heavy plate still 
provides some protection for you. You also accurately 
compare two armours of heavy plate.

Heavy plate provides the most protection of any armour,
but is almost always made of metal, and will interfere
with conjuring or natural magic.
