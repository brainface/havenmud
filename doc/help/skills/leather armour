LEATHER ARMOUR
Type: Passive Combat
Commands: compare

You are skilled in defending yourself while wearing 
leather armour. Your limbs protected by leather take 
less damage from attacks and damaged leather still 
provides some protection for you. You also accurately 
compare two armours of leather armour.

Leather provides only slightly more protection than
clothing, and can be quite warm. However, it never
interferes with spellcasting.
