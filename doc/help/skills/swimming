SWIMMING
Type: Passive
See also: <help set>

Swimming is less fatiguing to you, and you are less likely
to drown yourself. Note that many an unskilled swimmer has
perished in the ruined sea even on short swims.

Swimming on the world of Kailie occurs whenever you wander
into an area that is defined as ocean or "shallows", areas
which are not deep sea but which are not shoreline.

You can prevent accidently drowning death by using:
    <set swimming to off> (which is the default setting)
To enable swimming, <set swimming to on>.

Be warned that if you drown your corpse is likely to sink.

Many trainers teach swimming.
