REINFORCED ARMOUR
Type: Passive Combat
Commands: compare

You are skilled in defending yourself while wearing 
reinforced leather armours, such as studded leather. Your 
limbs protected by reinforced armour take less damage from 
attacks and damaged reinforced armour still provides some
protection for you. You also accurately compare two pieces
of reinforced leather armour.

Reinforced armour provides more protection than leather, 
but the metal reinforcing it interferes with conjuring
and natural spellcasting.
