<help atone>

You are connected to the spirit of the natural world, and 
with the aid of your deity can call upon the primal magic
that drives it. 

Evokation spells invoke ice storms on opponents or summon 
loyal animal companions, Healing can staunch bleeding or
even raise the dead, and Enchantment can create a natural
spring or repair wooden items.

Natural casters face a number of restrictions. They must
hold to the morality of their deity (or neutrality for
agnostics), metal armour inteferes with their 
spellcasting, and many of their powerful spells can only
be cast outdoors or while under the influence of a natural 
charge.
