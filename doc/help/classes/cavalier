Focus: Sword combat (non-magical)

Roleplay: Cavaliers are strict followers of the rules of their
          society and should be roleplayed as "knights" of their
          respective cities. Some cavaliers are good, and these
          should be played as strict upholders of justice and
          honor, while some cavaliers (notably Aberach cavaliers)
          are evil and should be played as firm tyrants with a
          very strong streak of honor.  These anti-knights are
          the type that will never dishonor themselves through
          lies and deceit, but will easily kill those opposed
          to them.
