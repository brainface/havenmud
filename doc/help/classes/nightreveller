Nightreveller

Focus: Enchantment and Music

Roleplay:  Nightrevellers are a combination of musician and enchanter
           They exist to force the unsuspecting person to forget their
           cares and dance deep into the night. Their spiritual chant
           of primal music laced with the magic of the Wild-Elves is
           a powerful combination of intoxicating passion. The 
           wild-elves have been blamed for the collapse of the Elven
           Empire based on their music, and human parents use them
           as an excuse when their children are ill. 
           "He must have been up all night with the revellers!" is a 
           common belief when someone falls ill unexpectedly.
