Focus: Faith-based magic with varying degrees of combat.

Roleplay: Priests are among the most worthwhile classes to roleplay
          on Haven. They are the priests and disciples of one of the
          religions of Kailie, and should be spreading the word and
          attempting to convert other players to the cause. The cleric
          has access to magic that varies by religion, and each cleric
          has unique skills for that religion.

Difficulty: Medium (varies by religion however)

** NOTE:  Priests also receive religion-specific skills.  Check
          the help file for each religion to see the skill sets.
