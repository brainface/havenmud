Focus: Alternate magic user.  Excellent roleplay options.

Roleplay: Bards are found in many cities, and they are usually
          found in taverns and other public gathering places.
          Their use of song to perform magic makes them a different
          form of magic user on Haven, using "sing" instead of "cast"
          to perform magic. Bards are an excellent class for roleplay
          in groups due to their number of room-affecting spells.

Difficulty: Hard
