Focus: Melee combat

Roleplay: 
  The Horrors are an ancient and especially vicious
  class of Daemons who have dedicated their lives to
  inflicting pain and fear upon everything and
  everyone. They value personal strength and as such
  do not dedicate any time to the study of magic
  or the use of weapons. Because of the hated nature
  of Saahagoth followers and the horribly aggressive
  and violent nature of Durgoroth society, Horrors
  typically do not live very long. However, those that
  make it to maturity are a force to be reckoned with.
  As a rule, Horrors are the embodiment of the creature
  under the bed.
