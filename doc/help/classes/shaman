Focus: Faith AND natural magic

Roleplay: To the faithful, the shaman is the staple of
religious life and activity. They are the medium through

speak in the material world. As such, they garner great 
respect from those in their community and are looked upon
as leaders. They harness great magical powers, combining
the faith and natural spheres into a whirlwind of
power. On the other hand, they are typically found in

Kailie and are treated as second rate magicians and
tricksters by the rest of the world.
