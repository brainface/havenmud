Fighter

Focus: Sword and Axe combat (non-magical)

Roleplay: Fighters are characters who prefer to hack their way through
a problem than think about it. They are completely combat orientated
and as such can be rather lethal. They can be commonly found in
barracks throughout the world. They are perfect for players who prefer
to avoid the complexity of magic, but want to see early results from
their efforts. 

Difficulty: Easy
