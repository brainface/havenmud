Focus: Sword and Knife combat, limited Natural based magic

Roleplay: Ninjas are powerful combat based characters. They are
similar to other combat classes, but have the added ability of
casting a selection of healing spells. They can only be found in Tai
Province, under the service of the Daimyo. They should be roleplayed
with a sense of great honour and loyalty. They have the ability to
learn the Ninjitsu combat style, which is a long hard process but is
worth the effort.

Difficulty: Medium

Ninjas are UNIQUE to Tairi.
