****What is a Player Inn?****

	A player inn is an inn that is owned by a player of Haven. Most 
towns have 1 player inn with the exception of Haven Town, which has 2.
The owners of these inns use it as a way to generate money as well as
provide a service to the customers of their shop, giving them a way to
earn some extra cash while buying food and other miscellaneous items 
from the shop.

****How does it work?****

	The player inns run on a system of buying and selling. The inn
buys corpses of races that the owner defines and sells different strengths
of meat to players that need or want food. Also, owners may put what
they have in their own inventory into what the shop may sell.

	If you are the customer, as long as the inn has an innkeeper, you
can carry on normal service with it. If there is no innkeeper in the inn,
it is currently out of business until the owner can provide one. The 
innkeeps work just the same as any other barkeep in a tavern anywhere else
in the world. They can list their inventory as well as tell you the prices
that they sell it for. They all work in the local currency of the inn
which is normally the local currency that the entire city operates in. If
you have a corpse, you may also sell it to the innkeep and the inn will 
pay you money for your corpse. The payout is dependant on the opinion of
the owner. Some inns will pay more than others and some inns might not
even buy your corpse if the owner doesn't want the innkeep to buy that
race of corpses. To find out what types of races the shop is buying
and for how much the shop is buying them for, just ask the innkeeper to
list, show, or browse payouts. Owners may also sell their own items to
players for certain prices, but shops can buy only corpses.

	If you are the owner, you have the ultimate control over the 
barkeep and what the payouts, prices are. Next is a list of commands 
available to you and their purpose. Note that you may get this list while
in your shop at any time by typing 'commands'.

	1) Funds. Using the 'funds' command, you may withdraw money from
or deposit money into your inn's bank account. Note that the currency dealt
with is the same as your shop's currency. For example, if your shop's 
currency is imperials, you can only deposit and withdraw imperials. Always
make sure you have enough money in your account to carry out transactions,
otherwise you may find that you can't buy corpses from players, therefore
you can't create meat to sell to players, which makes it so you don't earn
any money at all, making your barkeeper get mad at you because of you 
not being able to pay him so he leaves and you're left with an empty shop.

	2) Inv. Using the 'inv' command, you can put an item that you are
currently carrying, into the shop display case so that players may buy it.
Also, you may take an item out of the display case and put it into your
own inventory. Prices for these items in the display case are set with
the 'price' command.

	2) Make. This command has many uses. Using the 'make' command, you
can create an innkeeper for your shop, or create the three strengths of
meat that you will sell to players. Innkeepers are necessary for running
your shop, you can't do anything without one. However, you may only have
one in your shop at a time, so if you already have one, you may not
purchase another. The three strengths of food cost different amounts of
meat points that your shop earns by buying corpses from players. You may
create as much meat as you want as long as you have enough meat points.

	3) Price. Owners may use this command to set the price that 
customers must pay to buy the different types of meat from your shop, as
well as the prices for the different items that are for sale to players. 
You may set them to anything you wish, but remember it's all done in your 
shop's currency.

	4) Report. This is probably going to be the most used command in
the entire shop. Using the 'report' command, an owner may get a fully
comprehensive report on the status of everything that takes place in the
shop. It lists the current funds in the shop, the local currency, the 
amount of meat points available to spend, the current inventory on all of
the three types of meat available to sell, if you have an innkeeper or 
not and if so, how angry he is, who he was killed by (if he disappeared
due to death) how much you are charging players to buy the three types of 
meat, and finally, what you are paying people for their corpses of certain
races.

	5) Remove. The purpose of this command is to remove a certain race
from the payouts if owners no longer wish to buy corpses of that certain
race anymore. The syntax of the command is 'remove RACE'. So, if you want
to no longer buy dragon corpses, you would type 'remove dragon'.

	6) Set. Owners may use this command to set the payout of certain
corpses to a certain price. When a player sells a corpse to the shop, it
will check to see what the shop wants to pay the person for that corpse
by checking it with the payouts. Note that all prices are done in the
local currency of the shop. The syntax is 'set payout for RACE to AMOUNT'.
So, if you want all to pay 500 of your store funds to players that sell you
elf corpses, you would type 'set payout for elf to 500'.

	7) Setup. This command is used to change the name of the inn as 
well as the long description that players see when looking around in the
shop. New owners are recommended that they change the default "An unowned
inn" and the long description to something more suitable. Note that it
must be appropriate and Duuktsaryth may change a description whenever he
wants to whatever he sees fit. This is a powerful command that must be
used with care.

****Being an Onwer****

	If you are the owner of the shop, congratulations! You have just
purchased a fine investment. However, there is also a great deal of
responsibility that goes into it. You must make sure that your descriptions
are appropriate or you may find that suddenly you have been taxed by your
local city for a great deal of money. Also, make sure you're online often
to check your innkeep, your funds, and your inventory. If any parts of
these collape, your shop will quickly turn into an abandoned place.

	Your inn MUST have an innkeeper, if it does not, no business may 
take place. If you have no funds, you cannot buy corpses, or pay your
barkeeper his daily wage to keep him working. If you have no inventory,
you cannot sell anything to players, thus you won't earn any money to 
buy corpses or pay a barkeep, and the circle goes around and around.

	In the end, the player shop is a nice place to earn some money 
while giving others a chance to earn some money as well as getting a 
service, but it must be carefully taken care of.

****In the event of a problem****

	If you notice that something seems strange about the shop that
shouldn't be happening such as a bug in a command, or a barkeeper that
just decides to not take notice to any commands, mail Zaxan immediately
with the problem so that it may be fixed.
