  Welcome to Haven!  Your first course of action should be to read
  the newbie document by typing 'help newbie'.  Afterwards, it is
  recommended that you read the newbie basics document by typing
  'help basics'.

  This is not only for true newbies, but for all new players to Haven, 
  as Haven is a unique MUD and has many different ideas and commands you
  will want to know about.

  If you came to Haven seeking a position as an Immortal, please read
  help immortality for the guidelines for this.

  After you have chosen a class, it is a very good idea to read
  'help customize' and to use your free stat points.

  Last thought:  You are responsible for the info in 'help rules'
  It will be assumed that you are aware of them.
