  I hate to announce this already... but I'll be reorganizing the
  Immortal ranks and re-assigning people.

  It didn't matter for the last few years when Haven wasn't a real
  mud, but now that we have PLAYERS (woot!) again, we need the
  people that are working to be near the top.  This will be a 
  one-time adjustment and not a return to the old Duuk-habit of
  promoting and demoting on a whim.  I promise.  I just want
  everyone to be at a rank equal to the effort you've given and
  the skill you have around here.

  PS -- Thank you ALL for the help you've given in the last week.
