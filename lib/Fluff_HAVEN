Haven is a highly detailed, extremely large world with
a very small playerbase.  We need more players to grow!

Experience-point system complete with detailed combat
and non-combat skills, highly detailed magic system, 
player-run economics and even player-ownable ships!

18 Player Races, 20+ Player Towns, 8 Religions
4 Continents!
4 Planes of existence!

Newbie-friendly but geared towards grown-ups, run by
grown-ups with multiple years of experience.

We have a very low playerbase and we deserve better!  
Help us player-types, you're our only hope!
