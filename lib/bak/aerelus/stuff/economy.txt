It took me 25 minutes to make just under 860k imperials. I used Ishmael, and my bargaining is 
well over the cap (could you remove that? bargaining above a certain level is a complete waste of 
time right now)

I used the following npcs..

Matus - 100k imperials, 2 amber armlets, 1 amber diadem
Rath Khan - 25k (plus 0-25k) imperials, long evil looking staff, rune breastplate, 
  6 vests of aged chainmail from guards
Arcturus - 0-15k imperials, glowing elven rapier, huge longsword
Haven town - 8 suits of elfin chainmail - from templars
Temple (first lower plane) - 7 black stone staves, 1 marble staff - from lamrani master 
  and apprentices
Castle (fire plane) - 5 flaming elemental swords, 5 sparkling rapiers, 5 flaming elemental staves, 
  3 flaming elemental knives, 1 shimmering elemental knife

Those are what most people use to make cash. Everything else in the game is generally considered a 
waste of time for making decent money. Mining is pretty reasonable, I think you can make about 1m 
imperials if you fill up Ishmael with gems.

In addition, I know that Reno and John use dragons (can't speak for Max, he might also). When ballad 
of the seasons was bs, I could handly Kysanth. I still can, but it's risky, and I need an npc to guard 
me that doesn't take physical damage. Remember my char has an assload of spells.. none of the good ones 
seem to do much. I have to use knives for Kysanth. Rook is pretty much unkillable by me solo. Maybe if I 
was lucky enough to not be on the receiving end of a special bs attack, I could take her. Stryke, forget it. 

So, for the 300+ guys who can kill Kysanth and Rook before getting a special and exploding, they can make an 
additional load of cash anywhere between 0 and 760k imperials. 

Kysanth - 260k (plus 0-260k) chits
Rook - anything up to 500k imperials (see below)
       25k (plus 0-200k) imperials 
       50k (plus 0-100k) rupies 
       50k (plus 0-100k) bloodgems 
       50k (plus 0-50k) crystals 
       50k (plus 0-10k) senones 
       50k (plus 0-10k) koken 
       50k (plus 0-10k) rounds
       50k (plus 0-10k) cuicui
