Seabring Island
Pirate Refuge
By Atrus@Haven 05JUL04

Layout:
Fishing town - 
    rundown, low income
    poorly maintained sanitation
    sewage runoff, no sewers
    not a lorge town
    5 homes, 
    a fishing shop,
    a merchant,
    docks

Path leading out of town - 
    slightly overgrown
    sandy path
    random snakes
    about 10 miles long to other side of island
    
Pirate Hideout-
    lvl 50-65 pirates
    knife and scimitar
    raggy clothes
    one pirate ship that is being "repaired" (unstealable)
    decent treasure, nothing outragious

Small woods-
    25-30 square miles, 
    covers all of island,
    beaches and cliffs, 
    maybe a hidden cave
