Morning Arathorn!  I had some time at work so I'm reviewing your area.  Here are my comments about your #obj directory:

cleaver.c Repair skills and repair difficulty are much too high, a cleaver should be a fairly easy item to create.

r_knife.c Class is too high here.  Its only one point less than your two handed battle cleaver.  Also, there are no repair functions in the item.

Stay tuned for more critiques in other directories!

smallshield.c claims to be very heavy, the mass needs to be bumped up quite a bit.

slickblade.c - Your set history needs to be more specific.  And make it 
one of Kailie's greatest weaponsmiths or Kailies greatest living 
weaponsmith. or something like that.
