Hey lazy-ass.  Here's a short list for you.
All files are in /std/songs/test_songs/


Previously in-game songs:

	cleanse.c
	fury.c
	hlight.c
	joy_cac.c
	merry_euph.c
	sear.c
	tintin.c


Straight-up spells that just need a quick look to make sure I
didn't totally fuck up balance:

	ariaofair.c
	ariaoffire.c
	ariaofice.c
	ariaofstone.c

Marginally more complicated:

	starsong.c (like c_lit)
	fourseasons.c (combination of all ballad of seasons songs)
	decapo.c (bard rez song)
	reveillez.c (area haste)
	songofthedance.c (drains sp from targ)


Also needing approval:

all spells listed in /realms/duuk/amelia
Though I'd just go ahead and use the /std/spells/test_spells versions.
