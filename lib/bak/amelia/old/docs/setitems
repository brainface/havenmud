SetItems notes.

1.  Every single noun mentioned in the Short, Long, and Items descriptions 
needs to be defined in SetItems().

2.  Every permutation of that noun and adjectives that show up before it 
need to be include.

3.  Both singular and plural forms should be given. (if plural).

4.  If the noun never shows up with an adjective, give it one.

5.  The most descriptive string should be listed first.

6.  The descriptions should, on the whole, tell more about the Item than 
what has been learned before.

7.  This isn't a rule.  This is a hint.  If you have the following:
   SetShort("big clearing");
   SetLong("This is a huge clearing.  It is special.  It has a tree.");

Your SetItems could go like this:
   SetItems( ([
                ({ "big clearing","huge clearing","clearing" }) :
                   (: GetLong :),
                ({ "nice tree","tree" }) :
                   "The tree is deciduous.",
           ]) );
the (: GetLong :) calls up the long description.  It's very useful!  Do 
also note that those descriptions were incredibly *bad*, you'd be 
expected to make it interesting.


another note:  SetListen/Smell should be intersting and add something also.  not 
stuff like "It doesn't smell" but stuff about what it does smel 
like.

And get rid of any living creatures you describe in any descriptions, these 
shld be npc's.

and directions and invisible things shouldn't be described in Items, but 
possibly put in some sort of smell/listen thing.
