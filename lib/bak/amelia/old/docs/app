Things To Do While Approving an Area
------------------------------------

1.  Make sure they spell things right, use good grammer, etc.
2.  Make sure they have all the needed functions.
3.  Make sure the descriptions and general area aren't lame and are in
	theme.
4.  Make sure everything is balanced--long descriptions to the actual
	obj/npc, propers numbers and all.  Review "help balance" a lot
	until you can basically recite it. (:
5.  Make sure everything works, like exits and special functions.
6.  There should be preexits to prevent npc's from exitting and other
	ones to prevent npc's from entering (always) and then ppl from
	entering based on a #define'd variable at top.
	(These can be added at the end.  Just remember that it needs to
	be stuck in.)
7.  In places where a certain climate, smell, sound, etc. shld exist,
	they shld put it in there.
8.  Make sure they followed any and all other rules applying to areas.
9.  After doing all this great stuff, make sure you took notes that you
	give to the people so they can fix it.  Then when they turn the
	area back in, make sure they've fixed everything, and once they
	have, stamp an "approval" file for each directory.
Good luck approving. (:
