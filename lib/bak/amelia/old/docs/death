Mortals may die once on haven without resurrecting before they get removed
from the game.  Dying once means that you become a "zombie".  You can
resurrect when you are a zombie to become fully alive again.  If you die
while you are a zombie, you are removed from the game and have to start
over.
 
To get resurrected, you have to first find a healer.  Most towns have a
healer (like Dalahalus in HavenTown or Iuvo in Soleil).  Some will only
let certain religions or town members use their services (Zurlock is
just for citizens of Jidoor).  It costs money for a mortal to
get resurrected, but it's free for newbies.  However, there are drawbacks
to resurrection.  You may loose some skill levels or other things in
the process, however.  The syntax is "ask healer to resurrect me", like
"ask dalahalus to resurrect me" or "ask iuvo to resurrect me".  If you
can afford it, you will no longer be a zombie and can die again without
being removed.
 
The other way to get resurrected is through the spell "resurrect".  You'll
have to find a cleric with the spell who is willing to cast it for you to
use this option.
