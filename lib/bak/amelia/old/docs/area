BUILDING AN AREA ON HAVEN
-------------------------
 
Write a design file for the area (sample design file below) which includes
the name, theme, npcs, treasure, and intended level for the area.  Get it
approved by a sage+, then begin to code the area.  It is suggested to
read "help approval" and "help balance" before begining to code.
 
A sample design:
