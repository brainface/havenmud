APPROVAL
--------

To approve an area:

Have 2 creator+ look at it first and make the proper changes.  Than
have one sage+ approve it.  The following are some rules that must
be obeyed for an area to be approved.

First of all, everything must be in balance.  'help balance' will tell
you more about this.

For decriptions, the word "you" should not be used.  They should be
interesting and follow all grammer rules.  Also, every noun MUST
be in SetItems, along with every permutation of that noun using the
various adjectives that describe it.  Also, the lists in SetItems must
be put with the most descriptive permutation first, SetId and other
similiar functions should follow this pattern as well.

Finally, the code should be neat.  Code is often read for approving
areas, the ability to read that code is a must.

An example of using SetItems:


   SetLong("Large, beautiful trees grow here.");
   SetItems( ([
                ({ "large beautiful trees","large trees","beautiful trees",
                   "trees","large beautiful tree","large tree","tree",
                   "beautiful tree" }) :
                   "They all have long branches.",
                ({ "long branches","branches","long branch","branch" }) :
                   "The long branches are connected to the beautiful "
                   "trees.  There are pine needles connected to the "
                   "branches.",
                ({ "small pointy pine needles","pine needle","needle",
                   "needles","small needle","small needles",
                   "small pine needles","small pine needle",
                   "pointy needle","pointy needles","small point needles",
                   "small pointy needles","pointy pine needles",
                   "pointy pine needles","small pointy pine needle" }) :
                   "The pine needles are small and pointy."
           ]) );

Will the actual descriptions aren't the best, that example does show how
thorough SetItems ought to be.
