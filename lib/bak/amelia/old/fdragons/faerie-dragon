Faerie-dragons are small flittish lizards with butterfly looking
wings.  They generally have purple to blue bodies and rarely 
there are red hued ones born.  Their wings are always brightly
colored and glittery in the light.  They appear as true butterfly
wings, thin with a powdery residue covering them.  They have 5 
fingers as well as toes but are too small and oddly jointed to
wear any sort of armour.
