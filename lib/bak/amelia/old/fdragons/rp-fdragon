The faerie dragons are similiar to dragons in almost no aspect other 
than being reptiles.  They are extremely flitty and rarely settle 
into one spot for long.  They are not interested in the pursuit of 
power, only happiness and the perfect practical joke.

They are fast and innocent, generally expecting the best of everyone.
Due to their nature, they follow the god Gabriel and the Eclat way 
of life.  Very little would coerce a faerie-dragon to change religions
and ways of life.  

They make for excellent mages, however they tend to use their magic 
only to make pranks at someones expense.  Their speed also makes them
very good rogues.
