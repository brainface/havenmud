A cow pen

Desparately needing to be mucked out, the pen floor is covered in cow
pies and hay. There is a trough(not spelled rite)to one side that's 
filled with water and the remnants of some alfalfa hay litter the stall.
 

a large horse stall

The horse stall is lush, with about 4 inches of hay blanketing the floor.
A netted feeding hammock hanges from one corner filled with a few flakes
of hay. There are also two buckets, one with water, and one with grain, on
the floor.
