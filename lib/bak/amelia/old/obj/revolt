I lay down my arms.
I will not fight.
Your blackened guns and dulled swords turn my stomach.
if I had realized that the choice was mine to make,
I would have left long ago.
Yet not to be, I fought for a cause greater than my own.
What a mistake, a tragedy of self sacrifice!
I was a fool to think war against them --
Against anyone! --
Would do any good.
Now I know better.
They wronged us,
But there two wrongs make not a right.

I am sorry, my comardes.
This peaceful --
Peaceful! --
Tevolt has gone too far awry.
When we saw war on the horizen,
We should have fled the bloody thought.
I will take my weapons and burn them,
The greatest heart; the fury of hell itself will hold
Until every last part is scorched beyond all use.
I would not insult any other creation
By forming it out of blood-stained swords.
What true human, after all, would use the guillitine's blade
For a kitchen knife?
While you cretins speak lofty words
Of turning your swords into plowshares,
I shudder away.
Why make memory of your hate?

I lay down my arms.
I will not fight.
This time, I see the choice is mine to make.

God bless you with the sight to see it too!
