The Muezzins
------------

Muezzins are primarily short, cute, and furry.  They have large brown
eyes usually, but sometimes blue if the muezzin has white fur.  Fur is
also brown, coming in light, reddish, and blackish browns.  They have two
legs and arms, with 5 toes on each foot and 4 digits on each paw-like hand.
 
Muezzins tend to be very strong little creatures, best skilled at fighting.  
They also have a great sense of occassion, knowing when it is best to fight
and when it is better to make friends with those around them. They
consider no other intelligent races to be above or below them, though
they do look down upon evil races whose main purpose is to malicously kill.
 
The GodsWar came and ended before the muezzins first introduced
themselves to the other races, after peace had been around for a while.
Amelia, their god, concealed Soleil during the wars and spent time
preparing the muezzins to go out and stop the wars, but by the time
her army was strong enough, Duuktsaryth's elves had already brought
a stop to the war.  Muezzins are still all required to go through 
military training of some sort.
 
Now, the muezzin village of Soleil remains strongly built up in the trees,
where rope-bridge like crosswalks connect houses and trunks like roads do
in most villages.
