Eclat
-----

Eclat is the religion of Amelia, the Goddess of Joy.  The majority of
meuzzins follow this religion.  Its main purpose is to support the
life and joy of all people.  Accepting personal responsibility for
one's actions and constantly trying to improve one's self and one's
community at a slow and leisurely pace is the main idea.

A balance of chaos and order is necessary for a believer in Eclat.  Order
has its nice points, but chaos brings beauty and excitement into life; 
two things which promote happiness.  In general, being "good" helps with 
the goal of increasing the joy of the world.  Freely giving basic 
necessities to poor travelers helps as well (the starving man is rarely 
working on being happy).

There are few ranks to the Eclatish religion:  the Content, the Happy, 
the Joyous, and the Divinely Joyous (lowest to highest).  Chapels are 
scattered about the world, but the main shrine is in Soleil.
