
Soleil is in the West Wood, and is the center of the Eclat religion.  
All muezzins start out in Soleil.  Two classes are supported there:  
fighters and clerics of the Eclat religion.  There is one inn which 
also serves as the tavern, a bakery and a general store.  Oiseau is 
taught there as well.  The cuicui is the currency of Soleil.
