Eclat is the religion of those of lawful good alignment. 
The followers strive towards those qualities which they perceive
as the ideal state, one in which there is no selfishness or
pettymindedness, where the only ideal is self-improvement to
better one's environment. However, there is no rule against sadness 
or violence; with peace and joy, those two characteristics are necessary
for good to thrive.

In the past, Eclat was the religion of Joy as well as Good,
but Amelia, the Goddess of Good, realized that what is
joyful is not necessarily good, nor what is good, joyful.
Sadness and violence are needed in the world, but one must
always be striving for a better world in which less needless
violence and sadness exist.

All Eclat followers are encouraged to be helpful, especially to
each other.  The Eclats have set up a hospital in the WestWood,
and all of the faithful are requested to visit, heal the patients,
and help aid these unfortunate beings.

Most Eclats live in Soleil, the primary races being
halfling, gelfling, and muezzin.  There is also a shrine in an
Eclatish monastery in the WestWood, and another in Parva.
