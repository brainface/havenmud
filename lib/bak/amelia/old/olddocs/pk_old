 "Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself."

  While player-killing is a fun and enjoyable aspect of Role-Playing, a 
 person must remember that behind every character on haven is a real person 
 with feelings and emotions.  Haven is Player-Killing allowed MUD as it is 
 part of the Role-Playing experience but with a few restrictions.  Anyone who
 is the victim of Player-Killing has the right to request conference with
 an Arch on Haven to decide if the Player-Killer acted correctly and in an
 In-Character fashion, or if the kill was based on Out-Of-Character feelings.

  If the Player-Killing was done in an In-Character fashion, with no
 Out-Of-Character reasons, it is totally allowable on Haven.  If the kill
 has anything to do with Out-Of-Character experiences or to 'get even' with
 your real life friend, it is extremely untollerated on Haven and will be
 punished severely.  Players have been rid from haven based on bad player 
 kills.

  Reasons for Player-Killing include heated and hostile arguements
 In-Character, stealing, harassment and the rest.  Any kill that is not
 totally In-Character is totally unacceptable.  Player-Killing based on
 race, religion, profession, sex, sexual orientation or homeland is not
 at all accepted on Haven.

  Above all else, use common sense when entering into the Player-Killing
 realm.  Just as in the real world, violence is seldom the best solution to
 IC arguements.  How much fun is it to utterly destroy someone who is so 
 inexperienced compared to yourself when they can't even defend themselves?
