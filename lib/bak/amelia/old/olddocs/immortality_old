  If you came to Haven seeking a position as an Immortal, GOOD!
  However, in order to be considered for a position as an Angel,
  you must first demonstrate your familiarity with the world of
  Kailie.  The standard way to do this is by reaching level 10
  and then talking to an Arch.  The Arch will likely ask you
  several questions about Haven, including historical info, 
  theme info, and geography.  If you are seeking a position as
  an Angel, you should pay SPECIAL attention to these things.

  While the level 10 limit is NOT hardcoded and can be avoided,
  the knowledge of the mud cannot.
  Feel free to look around, and enjoy our world!
