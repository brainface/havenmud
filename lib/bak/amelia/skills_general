I.  Major Combat Skills:
----------------------
Attack Skills:  Higher levels mean increased damage, when using the weapon
type, and an increased chance of hitting the target.  These skills
are trained by using the appropriate weapon in combat.
Blunt:  Maces, warhammers, some polearms.  Anything that
does its damage through bruising and breaking, using
primarily muscles and brute strength.
Hack:   Axes, some polearms, and some swords.  Anything that
does its damage through weight and cutting.
Knife:  Knives, and other short pointed objects.  Anything short
that does its damage primarily by piercing.
Melee:  Unarmed.  Some types of gloves gives bonuses to
this type of attack (like spiked gauntlets).
Pierce: Spears, tridents and some swords.  Anything that does its
damage through well-aimed puncture wounds.
Pole:   Staves, canes, and some polearms.  Anything long and
skinny, typically doing its damage through bludgeoning.
Projective:  Bows, slings, throwing knives, javelins, and others.
Anything that uses a ranged attack to cause damage.
Slash:Swords.  Anything with a long blade that uses the
cutting edge, not the point, as the primary means of
causing damage.

Defense skills:  Higher levels mean a decrease in damage inflicted by
weapons of that type, as well as a decreased chance of hit.  The
various types are listed under "attack".  These skills are trained
by defending against the appropriate weapon type in combat.

Multi-hand:  Higher levels mean an increased ability to use all two-handed weapons.
This includes melee weapons, battle axes, greatswords, and polearms.  This
skill is trained by using multi-hand weapons in combat.

Multi-weapon:  Higher levels mean an increased ability to use more than one
weapon at once.  This skill is trained by using multiple weapons in combat.


The World of Magic:
-------------------
Casting of spells requires a "major" magic skill (such as conjuring).
This gives access to a group of basic spells.  In general, any high level or
really useful spells will also require a second skill--a "minor" magic skill.
Spells must be learned from a teacher, which is generally the same person that
taught you the skill.  For more information about the spell system of haven,
please reference <help magic>.

All magic skills are trained by casting the appropriate spell type.  Some spells
are more 'difficult' than others, corresponding to a greater increase in skill
with each cast.

Higher levels will let players:
1.  Learn more spells.
2.  Improve their knowledge of old spells, making total failure less
likely.
3.  Increase the power of old spells (if applicable; some spells
will not become more powerful with each skill level 
increase).

Major Magic Skills:
Conjuring:  Based on intelligence.  Used by mages.
Faith:  Based on wisdom.  Used by clerics.
Natural:Based on wisdom.  Used by druids.

Minor Magic Skills:
Enchantment:Spells of this type create/change objects.
Evokation:Spells of this type summon/call forth power.
Healing:Spells of this type cure injuries/diseases. *
Necromancy:Spells of this type involve unholy/dark magic.

(* Healing can also be used as a regular skill.  See the misc. section)

Miscellaneous:
--------------

Bargaining:  Higher levels allow players to buy objects for less and to
sell them for more.  This skill is trained by buying
and selling objects.
Fishing:  Higher levels allow players to have more success when fishing,
reeling in more fish, more often.  Training this skill
involves finding a fishing spot, and using a fishing
pole.
Healing:  Higher levels allow players to use bandages and basic first
aid more effectively.  Training this skill involves
using the command, "tend".  This skill is also
used in spells.
Stealth:  Higher levels allow players to sneak more effectively, slipping
in and out of highly populated areas without attracting
attention.  Training this skill involves sneaking.
Stealing:  Higher levels allow players to steal more effectively, with
a greater chance of successfully purloining the object,
and a lesser chance of getting caught by the owner.
