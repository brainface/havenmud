agorophobic -- fear of outside.
bad eyesight
don't like talking in corridors (get from point a to b asap.  blocks
	small tunnels, makes it hard to get around, possible mishaps
	w/ cave-ins and such)
most don't grow up in town.  town just a check-in point, more like,
	w/ others in other places around.  also has cemetary, so...
