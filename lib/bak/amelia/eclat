The Eclat religion is presided over by gods Amelia and Davantalus.  The Eclat faith is the
strongest force of goodness in the land.  The beliefs of the Eclat are simple:  All the
world should live without fear of violence or aggression.

Eclat is the true path to peace, good, and enlightenment.  Those of the Eclat faith are
sworn to only battle evil, though they have no oaths to prevent them from harming others or
taking lives.  An Eclat will not hesitate to remove evil from the world if they believe it
will bring righteousness.  While Eclats are a strong force for peace, they believe that
the only way to bring peace into this world is to prepare constantly for war.  The strong
forces of evil on Kailie make it impossible to do otherwise.  Regular forays of orcs
and goblins into their home woods have created a special animosty against those races on
the part of the Eclats.

The Eclat follower will be someone that makes every attempt to bring light, health, to the
righteous races of Kailie. To the Eclat, charity and generosity are harbingers of happiness
and goodness onto others. 

The forests of Kailie, Westwood and Havenwood, are almost entirely under Eclat rule. 
Members of the Eclat faith routinely make sure their homes are free of evil.  One would
best be careful while exploring in these domains if of questionable morality.

Gelflings, Muezzins, and Half-elves are united under the Eclat faith.  After the
destruction of the gelfling and half-elf home in the HavenWood, the muezzin Eclats
of the WestWood took them under their wing, protecting the remnants of their race
from annihilation.  Upon their return to the HavenWood, the gelflings and half-elves
continued to hold strong ties to Soleil, the main Eclat town of the WestWood.
