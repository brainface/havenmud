Natural magic (for general use):
/realms/amelia/callfirefly.c (npc is at /realms/amelia/firefly.c)
/realms/amelia/tame.c (goes with call firefly)
     (Eventually plan for call/tame:  Have other animals that you could 'call' that have
      different abilities--Example:  a bear that tries to rescue you from combat, or a
      unicorn with some healing abilities.  Would need to set a limit on the number of 
      animals you can call and/or tame.  My personal thought would be to start you out with
      one or two, and increase the number as you move up--maybe around level 50 get one more, etc.)
