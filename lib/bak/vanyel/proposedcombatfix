In weapon.c, change
  pro = random(pro);
  con = random(con);
to
  pro += random(pro);
  con += random(con);
Remove the defensive eventTrainSkill after !target->eventReceiveAttack

In attack.c
Remove the randoms from   if (random(defense) > random(attack) ) {
remove the     level_bonus *= 3;

In physical.c
Add a string parameter for GetDamage for the defensive skill(change all files that call GetDamage as well)
Subtract .6*weapon defense from dmg (approximately 1.5/4. To be more accurate, weapon defense+random(weapon defense)/4 would be more in line with weapon attack)
