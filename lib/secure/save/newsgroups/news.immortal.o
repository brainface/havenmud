Thats why Ungkh /sucks/ btw.  (i have plans to adress this after my current task list is complete.   i want ogres back and a chance like gene rodenberry to redux   my original idea.)Kuthar was created as an ancestral/earth religion for Ungkh Ogres.Originally Kuthar spells were based on rocks.Literally, ogres throwing effing rocks.and some ancestor worship.and a few low level shields.But this was back in the day when it took weeks/months to make high mortalThis is back when there was no river bjorn. there was no gurov/keryththis was when the northern most point you get to was the yozrath itself.there were no daemons and nosferatu lived in durgoroth in a multiculturaland multi religious open minded town.so over the years as haven changed, kuthar changed.ogres were removed as a player race.kuthar became the shamanistic ancestor worship of baria.kresh was still its own with its own god and rules.gwonish was not even a player town.as time went on draconians were added to baria as a player race.lizardmen became their own player race.goblins became kuthar. (unsure exactly when this happened)they all got dragon spells for kuthar.
