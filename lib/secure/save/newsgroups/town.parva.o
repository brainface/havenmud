Admiral Thrash has appointed me a position in the Parvan Fleet, and we have enough oros in the coffers to sponsor some new blood with promises of treasure, plunder and booty from our enemies cold dead hands!   While instructing you on the ways of sailing, I will accompany you on your journey as an aide, I'm no Boatswain's Mate, but if things get to dicey i can jump ship and attack the enemies head on to cease fire, if you know what I mean, Hehehe.        The Parvan ships are not to be used in such a manner to pillage merchant ships, or sinking fishing vessels. They are strictly for _sea control_ against the Pirates in our waters. When our ranks swell, we will discuss further grasps of sea control with the Parvan Fleet. Your personal agenda comes second to those raiding private ships in this sector.  It's time to do something more than be ruffians and drunkards, If you're tired of being a stain on Parva's deck than I suggest you stand up and do something about it. Join the Parvan Fleet!Any questions concerning positions, feel free to send me a mail at the post office and I will hastily scriven you a reply.--------Sea News--------    Damhair has praised us with an open passage to Tairi again, but the Endless sea is still VERY Dangerous.
