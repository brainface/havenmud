From this point on, I will be collecting basic equipment and placing them in my Keep.

The church needs to be free of such matters as it is a place of worship and training. I have redecorated my keep to house many,  trivial matters on where you rest your head should not be a problem.We are at the age where we set the standard.

The first I was approached by a sea-faring Parvan while in the Canyon near Jidoor.  He spoke of needing a friend like him in the coming war with Malvallient.  The other was far more disturbing.  A dark-elf named Yorin chased me through the desert even into Haven attempting to convert me.  He had a spell that allowed him to transport me so I was not able to escape him even by trying to lose him in the desert.  Has anyone had any similar experiences?  Can anyone offer aid as this Yorin fellow was quite a bit too much for one as young as myself to handle?Yours humbly,Tavia OrcsBane","read":({"tavia","ohtar","alessandra","duuk","adelmere","melchezidek","slush","sarin","yezzin","tavren","zom","zoron","mahkefel","tanov","aterruit","artanis","itkupaju","malvo","torak","urien","atrus","dux","shadorn","rhaine","victis","arzhang","zeratul","josef","liskan","zalbar","kara","sacris",}),"subject":"soirin",]),})
