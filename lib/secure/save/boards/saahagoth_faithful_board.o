However, our numbers are thin, andif we must fight, we must be certain it is to better our society in accordance withthat which was sent down from on high by the mighty Laoise.I suggest we instead pray to her to see what course of action she would like us to take. If they laid siege to the city, or harmed guards and citizens, we should prepare to fight. If this is another matter that brough itself upon our gates, we cannot be bothered with such matters. No matter the case, I ask that we instead pray and follow Laoise's guidance on this matter.","time":1090846744,"author":"Slush","subject":"Advice from on high","read":({"laoise","slush","aberilin","darken","dahaka",}),]),})
