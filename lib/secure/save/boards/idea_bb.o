As this will probably involve some discussion,I'd like for all responses to be posted here, so that we can allhave some input.Class cfg files are in:/secure/cfg/classesAlso, we are presently missing a ninja class help file, if anyone wouldlike to write one (see /doc/help/classes for examples). Note that someof the non-valid class files are in there, e.g. chaos-mage, but aren'tactually avaliable through <help> because they don't have existant cfgfiles.

I'll be able to write them up tonight after work.Mostly I'd like to make mages not completely dominant in the classed picks, and make classing actually be a good idea (have more then 160 dev points worth of skills).I'm also considering having the more war-like mage classes (coughevokercough) have a defensive primary, so that they can avoid the \"mind is clouded\" stuff in a RP way.","read":({"vanyel","zaxan","alessandra","dahaka","laoise","davantalus","artanis","amelia","duuk","liranae","zeddicus",}),"subject":"Calling dibs",]),(["author":"Duuk","time":1091484195,"post":"  Good call.  \"Vanyel Patron of Mages\", etc ;)  Also, since you wrote the original wandering minstrel, you  should think about bards.

Ranger theme I think is fairly obvious. The enchanter is the charming, sauve, casual mage who rarely goes to battle (thus the no combat primaries. I was a little iffy on the fourth, it came down to stealth or bargaining, and bargaining seemed more \"enchanting\" in a social kinda way. Not sure how much this makes them suck, but it's certainly less then they do now).The evoker is the usual mage-type you see on haven- capable of providing out-of-combat power, but specializing in defeating monsters. The three defenses (one primary) are to help with the \"mind clouded\" issue. I am pretty sure this will end up working well.And the necromancer, of course, is, well, the necromancer. I gave them pole attack as a primary because they'll need an attack skill to make corpses, and I feel it's appropriate for them to have an attack-focused personality. I gave them knife defense on the idea that they dodge poison-coated assassination attempts from each other (and it's also an assy and cheap skill).I will be reviewing the other classes in a bit, but those were the classes that I felt required changing. I tried to keep major changes to a minimum (I tried to only move skills one class up or down if they were important to the class) so as to not annoy the current players. The total dev point cost of making the class only changed ~10-20 except for enchanter (added ~60).Let me know what you think.","read":({"vanyel","zaxan","alessandra","dahaka","laoise","davantalus","artanis","amelia","duuk","liranae","zeddicus",}),"subject":"classes",]),(["author":"Davantalus","time":1091522571,"post":"They all look good to me.","read":({"vanyel","zaxan","alessandra","dahaka","laoise","davantalus","artanis","amelia","duuk","liranae","zeddicus",}),"subject":"classes",]),})
