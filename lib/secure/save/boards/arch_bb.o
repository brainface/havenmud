Specifically, I feel like we're getting into a lot of \"hesaid, she said\" type issues, where they will ask one of us our opinion,misunderstand it, repeat this misunderstanding to someone else, whowill then say \"that's not right\" (e.g. Liranae thinking I said she shouldmake all her rooms as long as the coffee shop). Or, situations where weactually have different opinions (e.g. me telling dakaha that I thoughtcamo was ooc for his area and should be changed, while I'm not sure ifAmelia felt the same way). Or us asking an angel \"well, what did yoursponsor tell you?\"Basically, I feel like we're setting up a situation which is very frustratingfor them and disorganized for us. I know part of this is working for so manyyears in a job where \"you never contradict your partner in front of a patient\"was the cardinal rule, so I'm probably overly sensative to it. But, it does feellike this could be a little more put-together.Is there a way you guys used to organize this that someone can enlightenme to? If not, I'd like to make a suggestion: that we tell angels that \"is thisok\" questions should be reserved for their sponsor. \"How do you do this\"or \"why doesn't this work\" can be directed to whoever's online at the time,but things that are opinion/QC issues should be reserved for their sponsor.This way they'll only have one set of standards to deal with, and we won'tbe contradicting each other. While I'm sure our standards all match in the end,our way of getting there or of explaining them to our angels may be different.Comments? Opinions?
