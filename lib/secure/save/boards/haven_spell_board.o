Just throwing some ideas out there. Thanks!Lunes BoonThis spell Draws from lunar energies to form a protective barrier around the caster which protects from bothphysical and energy damage.  The field shimmers and shifts with color like the casters own aurora. This spellmay be fortified if the spell \"lunar charge\" is cast before it.

This one works in conjunction with another spell which i will post afterwards.Storm AegisThis spell uses the rain to form a protective barrier of water which can absorb the kineticenergy from all but the most damaging physical assaults, rendering them harmless to theuser.
