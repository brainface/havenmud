Should we have classes at all currently?2.  If so, what's the standard for # of primaries, secondaries, etc?3.  And then, I need to fix the eclat clerics.  They have divination.    They even have repair skills, which Laoise said are out for now.    Their spells don't even use the skills they start with.Anyway.  I'm figuring on replacing divination with natural magicand swapping out the 'working' things (all of them) for like oneor two defense types.But then I'd like help from someone on the spell side in fixing thespells.Thanks.Amelia","read":({"vanyel","laoise","davantalus","artanis","amelia","zaxan","duuk","alessandra",}),"time":1089352933,"subject":"Eclat",]),(["author":"Zaxan","post":"Did there used to be a mend metal spell?

It passes on a percentage amount of damage based on how much it protects, so you'll see things like five buffer spells all get hit and the player still take damage, but it'll likely be tiny amounts of damage after all that. There is still some odd behaviour if they stack spells of opposite shielding types (an aura and a buffer, for example), in that some damage will likely still get through, but we've decided this is the best we're likely going to do with any easy fix.This involved editing the eventCheckProtection function only. I added a float damratio to be the damage ratio of what gets absorbed by the shield (since I only know of dual type damages, this'll be 0, 1, or 2 most often). There's then some checks later to multiply the damage taken to the shields or reduced by this ratio.I've tested this using both types of spells and multiple kinds of damage, so I'm fairly confident it works as desired.I also removed the \"static\" from AddHealthPoints per Zaxan and Duuk's suggestion in an effort to fix tend wounds not healing damage. It did not produce the desired fix, but since it may likely be required for the tend wounds fix and it is unlikely to break anything I'm leaving it as it is for now.","read":({"zaxan","artanis","davantalus","amelia","duuk","vanyel","alessandra",}),"time":1091861804,"subject":"/lib/livings/body.c",]),})
