__Letter "To begin with I want to apologize for my outburst with you this morning.I understand that you care.I think this talk is more about 'things i've said on i3' than it is anything else.I'm not actually a 'mean' drunk.I realize you can only go on the input you have received. whether from me directly or from others.what ive said on i3 isnt really me.  It's a reaction.  I'm sorry but I hate your friends on there.The Current-Allesandra/Me debacle is just that. yet another time when alli and i butt heads.This always ends the same way.I realize I'm an ass after TooMuchThinking<tm> and I apologize.Then she apologizes.then i apologize for making her feel thingsthen she apologizesthis goes on ad nauseum its really rather .. horrific and funny at the same time?I hope you consider coming to my pad per the email i sent yall this summer.it would be great for you to .. wel.. actually 'see' me and not the online persona.I truly hope you come and visit.~duder"
