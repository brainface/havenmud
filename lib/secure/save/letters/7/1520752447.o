__Letter "hey buddy,i'm attempting to make a 3d MMO out of Haven and its history.i just thought you might like to know that I will not be using 'your map'i asked you, some time ago, to redraw the map, walk Kailie and actually draw the map.instead, you gave me a plagiarized rendition of the old map, complete with all its flaws.i just wanted you to know, now, that you had a chance to be a part of this team.that you had a chance to offer a realistic border to the main continent of Kailie.and you failed.have a nice life,~Torak"
