__Letter "i've emailed you on a number of topics, attempting to get a working situation between us. i see you logging in. i don't see you replying to the offers of work. we (the team@haven) have numerous projects we could use help on. It is up to you (team player) to actually work within the team. Criticism is a part of the job. We have standards here at Haven which we (all of us) have been trying to teach you. I may have my personal feelings about you, but those personal feelings will not impede my ability to work with you for the betterment of Haven. I hope these words find you kind hearted. have a nice day, ~torak."
