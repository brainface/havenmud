Story "While not very wise, Redhaven has brought forth upon this world a terror beyond measure. He has limited intelligence but is a very quick study, he surprised his elders when they learned that he had the gift of magic, though not much else. He treads the world leaving death and decay in his wake, a scourge upon the world with no ties execpt those of blood to his brethren. No life is precious, no one is loved, only feared or eate."
