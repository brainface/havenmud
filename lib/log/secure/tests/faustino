What is your favorite area of Kailie and why?
Southern Seas because the Gnollish slave ships were interesting, the slave NPCs that burst out and fight againt the captain are interesting - also the imps in the catacombs are interesting as they try to hide and backstab


What domain would you like to work in and why?
Gurov or Crystal Reaches - because that area seems to have plenty of space on the map to build on


What religion would you be interested in helping with and why?
Damhair becaue who doesn't like the iron born


What is your least favorite area on Kailie and why?
In a Clearing in Estergym, it seems pointless, but maybe I've missed something.


Please explain your role-playing influence in regards to religion on Kailie.
I've noticed I've tended towards the neutrals and I don't know why because if I really focus on moral compass, I have to keep jumping between areas to keep the balance.  The actual religion I've focused on ever was Damhair, as noted the Iron Born.  But the sea seems vastly open and worthy of a lot more, even as varied as it is.  My desire to learn more of sailing and the seas here is why my cleric is Damhair.


Please explain your role-playing influence in regards to your town on Kailie.
Simple because of sailing and the readily available Damhair teacher/trainer.


Please explain your role-playing influence in regards to race on Kailie.
I choose human for versatility.  In the past I gravited towards sprite with my 1st char here 5-6 years ago.  Because I usually enjoy magic, but on my return I wanted to try a fighter and choose a lizardman simply because they were under-represented.


How do you feel about large corporations and their policies?
Its their business and in the protection of their interests I see no reason they can or cannot have strict policies at their discretion.
