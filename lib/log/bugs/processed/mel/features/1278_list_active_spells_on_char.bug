Bug        : A command that allows the player to view any buffs/debuffs currently affecting his character. For instance, I am unable to tell how many stacks of bloodlust I have if I already have a blessing. Additionally, the debuff would help players (sorry Adam) realize they have a disease (mana leech, looking at you!) and cure it if able instead of sleeping and waiting it out while curing their poor luck. It might also be helpful to include a method for displaying the different types of buffs/debuffs on the status bar. Not really sure other than like, "display 1, 2, or everything".
