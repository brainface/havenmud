Bug        : When purchasing items from a vendor, I can price the items by their line number (i.e. ask taylor to price 004).
However, I cannot purchase items in the same way. I believe vendors should be able to sell items by item number listing. 
It would help reduce confusion and streamline item buying for vendors like armor vendors with different item types of similar nouns/adjectives.
