Bug        : Character limits for player stories should be doubled from its current limitation. I find when I actually get into writing a story, I write way more than can fit and then i end up having to the trim the story down to a small summary and it kind of takes the fun out of actually having a good story.

Alessandra:   Mike had mentioned wanting to be able to "append" stories as well.. later on when you've played them awhile. Both worth looking at?
