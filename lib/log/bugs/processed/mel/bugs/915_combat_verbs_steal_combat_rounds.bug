Type       : SCREAM COMMAND

Status     : NEW
Bug        :  
if i scream in combat
then look around the room before the scream happens
i dont scream at all

## this is presumably the same issue Torak documented in 1079.
combat actions/combat verbs don't process if you use other actions
that take combat rounds (ie look, status shouldn't, but look should)
