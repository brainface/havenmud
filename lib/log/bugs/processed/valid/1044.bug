Bug        : gustav, skill trainer in keryth
takes imperials not senones

--
This has to do with how currency is populated in trainers.
It uses GetTown() and this trainer in particular is 'all' so it defaults to
the common currency of imperials.
Would need to add SetLocalCurrency() in /lib/npcs/trainer.c and appropriate
checks to make this work.
