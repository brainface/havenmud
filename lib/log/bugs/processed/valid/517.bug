Bug        : Duuk, put in some kind of journal system to make notes.  while you are at it, add in a way to create scrolls and books by players that make it into a library.  You can require anything going public get approval, but it would be a nice way to open up sharing experiences in character and could help preserve the storylines that leave when players leave.
