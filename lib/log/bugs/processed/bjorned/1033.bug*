Bug        : This doesnt exactly belong here but the quest to kill Lord Beornwulf should be lowered, I think its at like 40 or something, we orcs need more quests from 11+


// TORAK //

the vast majority of these quests need to be leveled differently.
there are a number of haven town quests that players can't even
get until they are passed the point where what they are doing is even
worth any XP at all.
