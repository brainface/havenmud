Bug        : Skaven players description options are very lacking.

is it just me or do they all just look the same?


Options for "eyes" are: skavens : black

Options for "hair" are: skavens : black

Options for "skintone" are: skavens : grey

Options for "skintype" are: skavens : furry or thinly furred

The extra data for skavens is thin fur and an elongated, rat-like snout.
Aless Notes: Please can we all just gang up on Duuk and have descriptions changed back.. or added to.. or something? 
I'm ok with these descriptors.. in general.. (and adding more options to them) but could we not also have back
custom descriptions? We're not all young and stupid anymore.. Mostly. Sort of. /sigh

# We can do this, make sure it's reasonable. Get me a list and I'll add it to
 /include/description.h
