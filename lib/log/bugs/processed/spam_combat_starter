Bug        : 
Before combat begins, you cant spam cast, or spam disorient things.
the first one is s'pposed to start combat, but the effects of
combat do not slow down until combat begins (the next heartbeat)

so sometimes you only get one cast of a spell before the hearbeat kicks in and combat slows down your actions

and other times you can spam it and get 4, 5 or 6 in real quick like.

I dont know of this is something we can fix
but mike was very upset with me for not reporting this sooner.
