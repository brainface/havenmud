Bug        : Add handling for property 'NoBleed' so things like skeletons don't bleed. Because that's silly. Also, NoPoison, NoDisease, etc.
Should be handled via various actions, eventBleed, eventPoison(this doesn't exist, should have a better name too), eventSuffer (also doesn't exist, but sounds exciting)
