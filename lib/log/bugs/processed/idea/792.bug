Bug        : having played non magic users on haven i have noted that
they lack the limb dismembering qualities of the mage.  especially the skill
accuracy.  it targets the head first.  while i undeerstand why i feel this should be
more apporpriately balanced by allowing a player to 'target' the left leg
or 'target' the right arm, etc.
