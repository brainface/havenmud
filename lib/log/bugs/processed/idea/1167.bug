Bug        : Keep command, to not sell things to a merchant. Haven has tons of axes, trying
to identify them is a bit weird. If i 'keep' my special axe i should be able to
sell the ones in my inventory...not the one i want to keep. OFC this will not
apply to things worn/wielded, just things loose in your inventory.
