Bug        : a few spell idea... 1. a high level paralysis spell... called stun or bind. 
cast temporal barrier
                    2. a spell that boost the next spell you cast... caster cast the "boost" spell and then casts a low level spell like fireball and that creates more fireballs and has a greater chance of not being repelled. 
                    3. maybe only two spell ideas this time.
