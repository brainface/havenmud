spell idea for Damhair clerics.  summon wave so Damhair cleric is able to sail in any available direction. example cast summon wave and then cleric is prompted for direction.  spell failure could cause damage or wrong direction.

I don't really like the original idea, cuz sailing check but better, but further ideas from rich are "push opposing ships away" or "like fear but for ships"
