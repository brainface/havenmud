Bug        : Could it be possible to have an underground of thieves who have influence with politicians in cities to lower negative favor? Not all cities like Orcs/glimmerdin or dark elves/high elves have opposites to gain favor.


Mahkefel: I don't think you should just be able to pay money to raise reputation, as frankly it can be relatively easy to amass huge fortunes, but some sort of quest/job for thieves might be fun.
