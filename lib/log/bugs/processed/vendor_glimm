Bug        : The Jirvin arm's seller doesn't allow me to choose to helm or gauntlet that I wish to buy.  He sells both plate and heavy plate items.  I cannot say, buy small steel helm, which is different than small heavy steel helm.   I can view the 13th item in the list, but I cannot buy it.  It would be nice if I could buy an item by fully writing out its name and/or it would be nice if I could purchase the 12th, or 21st item on the list.
