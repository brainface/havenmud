Bug        : I have a coastal boat, and tried sailing all the way around haven, going clock-wise.  I got to gurov, but I can only sail east several squares before it says I can't go any futher because I would be going into deep water.  I am right next to the shore, but cannot go any futher.  Anyway, just a thought.
