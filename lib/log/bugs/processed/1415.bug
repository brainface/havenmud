Bug        : Mining appears to be broken.

Not sure why I added extra spaces here, but whatever. So I can mine any room (in Glim for example) and I never receive any gems, nor a message about the room being "mined out". I just "continue to mine the ground" until I run out of stamina. FWIW, my mining is in the 150s at the time of this report.
