Bug        : Using armour skills to resize pieces of armour. This would add to the use/desire of the skills, but consequently reduce the importance of race choice. If the armour being resized is magical, this could also require a magic skill (enchantment, etc).

Additionally, it might also be possible to add the "resizing" feature to current smiths or vendors for a sum depending on the rarity/stats on the piece, any/all magical properties, and how many size levels you are going (i.e. small to large or small to medium).
