Bug        : The 'gate' spell currently requires a room to be loaded for it to work. It would be nice if casting
gate on an NPC forces a room to load. This would give alot more places to gate to as at the moment
with so few players you can only gate to where you have been. Not sure if 'teleport' or other similiar
spells are the same but if they are they would also be better with this change.
