Bug        : On alignment and faith spells: (2) possibilities.
1) A "remorseless" spell where your actions do not impact your alignment for a set amount of time.
2) Instead of not firing at all if one's alignment is not consistent with their faith's requirements, the spell will be negatively impacted by a certain percent based on how far away the character is from their stipulated alignment.
This might help address issues where players cannot use spells mid-combat due to a same-combat death negatively impacting their alignment (based on their religion), as well as make more sense from a faith standpoint.
