Bug        : This idea would be to better reward players with trade skills (such as fishing, farming, and mining) by also putting them in danger. The basic principle would be to create areas with hostile creatures, but to scale the rewards received for using those skills in that particular area. The example brought up would be fishing in the Frozen Lagoon. The fish caught in that area would be of a much higher "quality" and worth a ton more experience than say fishing in Platypus Bay. The higher level the area, the more rewarding XP-wise the skill provides. Additionally, your trade skill needs to be high enough to "work" in that area as well. If the area is for ~100 level players, then your skill would be expected to be somewhere in the 175-225 range (right?). This would also help mining for instance: the areas that aren't hostile you can only find really low-level gems -- perfect for a beginner, but not worth the time for an avatar. Throw crazy gems that give a lot of experience in areas where you might get your face nuked, and it become a lot more tempting.
