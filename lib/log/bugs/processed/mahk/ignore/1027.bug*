HEY JOHN!
basically, this dude died, respawned, and hit "KILL ALL" before he had a chance to think and ridded himself.

Duukk... may have added a second of paralysis to death, I made some cemeteries "no attack" before I got bored. This cemetery IN PARTICULAR contains a quest npc you're supposed to kill for kylins, which makes adding no attack vaguely problematic. (Easilly solved by the non-lazy by moving the dude.)

## this was just sheer stupidity. Plain and simple. Or, more likely, a trigger that ended up fucking them.
I don't think we need to change anything about the location of this NPC or the status of this cemetery
as this is Durgoroth and it's supposed to be for advanced players.
