Design Notes of Mahkefel:

Really, I envision combat actions kind of like City of Heroes.
Like, giving people a really simple rotation of a starter
attack, a finisher attack, and one you just spam.

With a few other situational/toolbox attacks to use to make things
interesting.

I imagine splitting styles into "tanky" and "damage" like every MMO
ever. Tanking might not work exactly, but we can absolutely make
serenity-like verbs for damage-based classes currently.

Berserking: Area damage. Tanky
Cheap area attacks (cleave @ 50sp),
Stat Bonus to strength and durability.
Gains "rage" on every hit.

Sword Slinging: Good single target damage. Tanky
Tends to high damage efefcts (run through @100sp)
Stat Bonus to strength and agility.
Gains "rage" on every kill

Swashbuckling: Generally single target damage/debuff.
Has a few tricks.
Stat Bonus to agility and luck.
Gains "rage" on every /miss/

Dirty tricks: Damage-based
debuffs, tricks, and single target damage.
No current stat bonus, this may change.
I'd like to add several "wound" debuffs sort of like
the opposite of planars.

----
unimplemented (so basically just brainstorming)

Acrobatics: Tanky, tricksy
melee & pole based attacks.
Momentum: bonus to speed/agility/coordination

Archery: Damage based
Aim?: bonus to coordination, agility

Bushido: Tanky
Slash & pierce style (katana & wakizashi)
costs more, but gives appropriate spell-like commands
(like bless weapon, ki shout, fiery sword strike or whatever.)

----
A style that gave a lot of buffs to party members should be fun.
Something like "commanding" or "leadership". A bunch of buffs that
don't work on self or work much better on teammates.
