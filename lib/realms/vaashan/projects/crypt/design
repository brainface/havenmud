Theme:

An underground crypt which is the home of a powerful and undying sorcerer.  It 
is lavishly appointed, as it is not only his home but his prison.  He is 
cursed to remain within the crypt, as his immortality only lasts while he is 
within.  He has summoned a force of djinn to serve him, as well as human 
slaves.  Highlights include a harem, a lavish living chamber, and a treasure 
room.  A well fortified keep sits above it, guarded and well appointed but a 
bit dusty, as it was the sorcerer's home before he was cursed to live below 
the sands.

NPCs: 

Djinn, human slave servants and warriors, human women for the harem.  Level 
range 40-80.

Treasure:

Some weapons and armour, perhaps some nice scimitars for the djinn.  Some nice 
clothing for the sorceror and a staff of some sort.  I'll probably have him 
carry a key for a chest within the treasure room that can contain some minor bauble.
