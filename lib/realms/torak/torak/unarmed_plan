unarmed combat is terrible and we want to play monks.

we need a passive boost for monk types!

Unarmed Combat!

(as a boost skill akin to 'ice magic' but for unarmed combat 
 or just edit melee combat for our needs)

and we'd like to add a boost to dodge skill for dodging while
unarmed (unencumbered by that heavy weapon).

Unarmed Combat would apply a damage boost to all those extra
attacks you get with melee combat that currently suck and are a
spam of misses and no damages. A level 200 unarmed combat player
should get around 2/3 max damage as a SetClass(50) weapon 
(xtra attacks keep in mind) and have a comparable (if not better) 
to hit ratio than their weaponized counterparts.
