Game History :
The Glistendin Mountain exploded! It was once a mighty mountain,
home to the Dwarven Mines of Glistendin and full of riches but
the long dormant volcano erupted. The western mountainside
remains intact and serves as a giant wall while a natural port
was created to the west. This change in landscape drew the eyes
of pirates, brigands and what was a shanty town of dwarves
became a thriving port of ill repute. The dwarves, with a keen
sense for profit, adapted to their new mine : the port and the
sea.
