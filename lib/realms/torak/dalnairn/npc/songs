hearse song

have you ever thought as the hearse gos by
one of the days you are going to die ?
the motor opool sends out a car 
you goin for a ride  but you dont get far.

as you watch the death wagaon riding by 
you dont know wether to laugh or cry 
you wish it werrent but you kthat its tru 
the very next load may consist of you

the burial detal lowers you down
the officers they just stand around
they shovel in dirt they shovel in rocks
they dont give a damn if they break the box

the worms crawl in the worms crawl out
they creep all over your chin and mouyth
they call in their friends, their friends friends to
you look like hell when they get through.

your eyes drop out, your teeth fall in
the worms are all over your mouth and chin
each one takes a bite or two of what the pentagon says is you
