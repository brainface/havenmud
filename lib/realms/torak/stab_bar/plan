npcs generated may or may not attack eachother.
Other npcs not attacking may or may not be friends with any side.

The band, if not attacking, will play songs for a price.
(they’ll yell not sing so the whole bar hears it)
These songs are totally not rip offs from real life. I swear.

Bathroom is the worst god damn bathroom ever.  Trainspotting bad.  Vomit would make it cleaner.
Literally hurts you over time just being in there. It also counts as a safe/no cast zone

the office is guarded with henchmen and filled with various weapons, paperwork. A large heavy safe sits in the corner.

Alessandra <imm> there needs to be some dude who is slumped over in a far corner booth that has
    been there for weeks and no one knows if he's dead or not


Stabby Lynn also has a get away boat outside the back entrance/pier.
