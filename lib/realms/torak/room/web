A dreaded mayonnaise spider web [mayonnaise]
Long, thin strands of a sticky mayonnaise webbing artfully create this dripping web. The web is
secured to something somewhere in the bleak darkness. The dripping spider web is a pasty white and
appears to take the shape of a magnified snowflake.
It fucking reeks of mayonnaise in here. Jesus Christ.
The fact that mayonnaise has a sound is ming boggling and somewhat disgusting.
