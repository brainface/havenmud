* GetLong() of environment of doll target

* eventForce("say $*") to doll target

* restore limb of doll target

* eventMove(direction) to doll target // would have to check for swimming set to off

* give disease to doll target // not a life ending disease, something interesting

* rezz doll target

* a kuthar themed spell with varying outcomes based on caster's alignment
    ie: good -> heal, neutral -> effect, evil -> damage
