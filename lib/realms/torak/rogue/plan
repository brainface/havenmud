WARNINGS :
one would need to be -equipped- before entering
possibilities include not being able to leave a
certain dungeon levels without, for example,
a SHOVEL!

Plan - Haven Rogue-like

Draw up a new town, even the thri-kreen one 
in the desert, fully functional as player town.

-OR-

Recode Goblin Town - some of the SetLongs in 
that town are ONE SENTENCE.

-OR-

Use what exists on the island south of haven 
town - frenchville

Make this town home base with an entrance to 
a mine\tunnel\mountain\whatevs for the local

have a few varying virtual rooms of similar 
length and width with varying degrees of travel
(twisted forest planes\fire planes\rooms with 
connecting hallways\giant rooms with rows of 
columns)

each level, or maybe few levels, would 
represent one difficulty level (1-5, 10-20, 
etc)

the bottom of would be the home of a powerful 
(insert monster here)

my suggestion is an undead form of a fallen 
elven lord that once stood post at a tower 
on the edge of civilization (in keeping with 
the haven lore.  if we talk about these lords, 
besides rath khan, where are they?).  this 
lord would be for someone of avatar at least 
to hunt.  probably demi-god or something.  or 
otherwise something fit for the chosen location.  

considering a somewhat shorter dungeon that 
checks your level when spawning NPCs to be a 
repeatable quest that scales to you.

oh yeah, death == purge

The end dungeon master toon could be some interdimensional dragon that eats the souls of all whom enter.  we could do like dungeon crawl:stone soup and have the ghosts of dead players come back as npcs.

the rooms files would load a randomly chosen virtual room for each floor
level so every reload would be a different experience with different
items, features, quest options.  (each kind of virtual room could
contain a different trick to escaping it alive.  whether that be
finding keys, or pushing stones.)
