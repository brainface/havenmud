Trying to let players gather/buy goods and sell them
in far away lands for profit. Land-Only Routes would
bring in far less money than Sailing Routes.
Certain Towns may want certain items based on RP

  ie: keryth wouldnt want to buy pearls nor gems. 
      but oranges on the other hand..

May Require Special Vendors from Space Opera Haven

Delivering Goods to any Town would increase Reputation.
