TRADE WINDS SIMULATION

--------------------


new command 'tradewind <direction>'
or something better and easier to type


only works in certain sections of the oceans that we establish as 'trade winds'
using this command would make you go 2-3 directions in the chosen direction
                                  vs
only going one direction south with 'sail south' to simulate are wind current

small route start : haven->frenchies->tairi->baria->lloryk->sanctum->haven
big route start : xandria->baria->keryth->gurov->parva->haven->tairi->xandria
