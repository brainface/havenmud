the quiet times when we hold hands

our warmth and fingers int'rtwined
above the valley, way up high
it's amazing we've come this far

dreamin' a vacation o'er nigh-time glasses of wine
the stars all out, shinin bright
we wonder, 'where is mars?' 

the moon comin' o'er the mountain right on time
holdin yer hand all through the night
