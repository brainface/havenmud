id like to have a long hallway with doorways.
doorways leading to stairs going up to 
  the balcony or down to the dungeon.

each doorway would lead to a specific key for the next door.
  make it a larger key puzzle game than the haven mage tower.

the hallway end at the large super door which leads to
  another stairwell.  this one goes up a 3 story tower.
  once at the top, the lord of the castle awaits you.

i would like to make it so once you enter his chamber
  you are dedicated to the event.  ie : cant leave nor
  teleport out in any way.
