150 - 200 leveled area

gurov area

day longs and night longs differ
day is a nice peacful forest
night is a twisted cursed forest

day is human that whisper amongst themselves
and point at you as they walk by
a town in the forest on the path to a stone castle

night is scared humans that get attacked by :
werewolves!!! dun dun dun

the town has a smithy and forge, open during the day
they sell silver weapons
(werewolf killers)

the path from the start of the forest to town is short
from town to castle is longer and twisted up a mouintain side

the castle should be large and in charge
open courtyard inside the walls
a 3 story tower
werewolf lord lives on top


a level block would prevent noobs from
walking from town to the castle however
the town is open to all.

I would like the werewolf NPC files to query
  the phases of the moon.  if both moons are
  full, they are stronger and faster.  each
  moon would represent one or the other.

I'm using the code from the yurei except instead
  of check undead, im check SetProperty("lycanthrope", 1)

this means the weapons he sells can be used on future lycathropic areas
