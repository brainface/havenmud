Possible Battlestar Galactica game... Can run basically as a 
text based simulation with save points and possibly multiplayer adaption.
As long as both parties start a 'joint op' at the same time the mission 
would be taylored to the average level of the 'party' involved.

The 'party' for this write up will be "All members of the player group, 
allied or not, who are in the same 'instance' of the game at the same time."

The Instance for this example can be 'missions' 'quests' 'things' and 
'joint-ops'. Each aspecific mission to carry out while preserving the slice that is left of what
was once Humanity. Roughly 50,000 people to work with to start. Random hidden encounters throughout 
large quadrants of space that could easily become 'away missions' mandatory for the completion of 
each encounter. You are the captain of a Battlestar. The last bastion of hope for the fleet that is 
running and hiding from the deadly Cylon invasion forces, these forces may show up in the middle of
a mission which then requires them to choose between victory or defeat. Never being able to complete
any major story quest more than once, for good or bad, while secondary objectives may be completed at
will, repeatedly, for a discounted XP%.

Your experience in the game starts out asking your name.

Your class would be one of three styles of captain...

Tactical
Engineering
Flight

Next would be your primary skill availability...

Diplomacy
Battle Tactics
FTL Calculations
Communications
Leadership (Required)
More...

Secondary Skills... (sub class, what you did before you were a 
command officer)

Medic
Flight Crew
Deckhand
CIC Officer
Operations Officer
Intelligence Officer
More...

Each Secondary would have a subset of skills that the player 
will never see, or may see only when choosing the class. This will 
make for more unique gameplay.

Quick Story notes:
Our intent AS DEVELOPERS, is to kill the players!
Making this damned difficult at every turn. I want this to feel like you are the Commander of a 
Battlestar and Death by any number of horrible things, be them cylons, or bandits, or whatever.

You will feel the slow combat creep through your bones as you await the reports from around the ship. 
Every choice you make will have consistant and profound impacts on your fleet. You begin with 
5 ships (1 battlestar; 2 supply ships (doubling as civilian transport); and two support ships (one 
mining one refining)

Your Battlestar has a crew of 2,500 people, the systems are NOT networked so they all work 
independantly. We have to find out what class the Galactica was and model it off of that.

The remaining 47,500 people in the fleet are spread across the remaining ships.
we'll figure that out for balance.

Fleet ships will be upgradable but minimally, support ships may be able to get FTL Shielding 
and 2-3 turrets, but no more. The Support ships are virtually defenseless when the game begins.

Fortunately when the game begins if the Cylons or any immediate threat that calls for a civilian 
FTL jump, they will automatically do so and the coords for it will be uploaded into your main
nav computer as a waypoint.

I would adore if the movement could be based upon movement vectors but up down left right forward 
back should suffice. I would also really like the Raptors to be pilotable, but that would take 
signifigant more development and that's not really the point of this particular game. 
Perhaps one mission

Perhaps we could incorporate the concept of 'Turn-time' combat, choices that have to be made within
a time-frame (so many seconds depending on what it is) which will each tell the story a little 
differently.

Screen readouts and a status bar. Screens just showing screen prints basically. "You are here"
"They are there" "Here's the ships status" and "Here's the ship profile map with indicator lights"


Encounters would begin as reports from a duty station presenting a choice to the party. 
As players they have constant open coms so they can 'talk' ship to ship. Each choice regarding the
fleet goes to a vote and then to the highest ranking officer to confirm. Each choice will 
effect each ship differently, albeit just % of losses/gains based on the encounter vs each players
combined skill levels in the particular encounter.
