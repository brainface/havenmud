Gurov (mostly for quests in this area)
Turnip Farm with Lady who sells borsht * **

Wandering Cake vendor * ***

Quest guy * ***

Oil Ocean (big oozy creatures)

Isien Fortress (tundra dwelling lizardmen being sieged by Goden)

Ice Ogre area (closer to Keryth)

Haunted Amphetheatre (bards and ballet dancers here)

Namatar
Gorge (Cretean and Minoan stuff. Given to Kairii) **
Mt Akrotiri (volcano; ash monsters, fire elementals) **
Olin Crater (big scary lizard things, dare I say dinosaurs) **
Labyrinth/Temenos (a maze beyond a small area of priests) **
Centaur Clan areas (to be incorporated with minotaurs)
Warring Minotaur areas (definitely need some kickass minotaur dudes fighting each other, with nifty loot)
Phaestos (City, in case it's needed) **

Xandria
Barley and Emmer fields (elf workers, gnoll overseers, cattle, etc)
Evil Temple (temple of healing up top, lower levels are proceedingly nastier and forgotten and full of evil priests) **

Staircase leading up to an ethereal level where Banished Ones and Oathbreakers are (Hebrew mythos, fallen angels and such still doing the work of Duuk for the Antekys)

Wadi/Plateau (giant birds; Persian myth influence with Simorgh, Homa, Samandar, and a Palace of the Eagles)

Lotus Fields (good aligned people, dunno what all else)

Barren of Storms (sand creatures, golems, red clay area with fire wyverns)

Lost Falley (an ancient necropolis gone bad with undead burnt fleshy dudes, walking dead, mummies, skeletons)

Lower Canyons (late egyptian and eastern mythos, djinn and daemons. may work better for yozrath)

Enchanted Garden (based on Hanging Gardens of Babylon, but overrun with sprites and brownies and such)

Skaven Encampment (All sorts of soirin guys amassing a secret army in the woods somewhere, maybe on the Keryth side of Gurov Rd, mostly rogues, soirin clerics, and the goden joining them almost hafta ride big ass war newts. Yes, I'm pretty much set on war newts.) ***

Reno's area to be looked at

Small Mononoke forest based area for Havenwood * ***

Small Fungal Marsh area (near Sanctum? haven't decided. these last couple are just to give mortal guys something different to play with occasionally) * **

Arcane Reliquary (a zone in the ether you have to get to by travelling from the averath mage tower full of puzzles to get specific keys to unlock some specific door to get a nifty bit of loot) **

Averath Mage Tower (i figure you can't have enough high level mages to fight. it's also got a place where you can portal to the reliquary)**
