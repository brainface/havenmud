Tameria

Race: Draconian

Theme: Persians- rip off

Religion(s): (Soirin offshoot.. and Kuthar?)

Tameria is an amalgamation of various separate Draconian tribes that had previously been scattered across the Xandrian desert. 

Brought together by (some dudes name here), at times by sheer brute strength, they were largely nomadic. (Same dudes name) continued to lead the
Draconian across the desert, conquering and absorbing tribes as he searched for land within the desert landscape that would be viable to build
and sustain his empire.

Near the harsh border of the Endless sea and the desert, (dudes name) was visited in the darkest hour of the night by a creature that emerged
from the chaotic depthsâ€¦ a cross between a woman and a winged serpent. And the inky night sky was blotted out by an enormous golden dragon
whose scales glittered and blinded when hit by the moonlight. 

Where the woman crossed from sea onto land the sands parted for her and formed an inlet. A river which would sustain life. And where the dragon
beat his wings the landscape shifted and rose and where he landed the earth gave way.. creating a valley surrounded by golden mountains and
cliffs formed from the pale earth and sand of the desert that would protect the city from the harshness of the desert and hide it from any who
would try to take it from them.
