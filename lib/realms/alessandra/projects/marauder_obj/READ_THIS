A buxom corsair:
cor_boots.c
cor_corset.c
cor_shirt.c
cor_pants.c

Donnie the badass:
don_cloak.c
don_tricorn.c
don_dagger - description

Rat pants:
rat_pants.c

Also:

** It would be SUPER awesome if don_cloak.c gave some sort of dimming effect
NOT like the spell dim or invis or anything BS per se. Just like it would be if someone
created a few dark globes or something.

** Please feel free to edit any of my values for warmth/value/mass/damage/etc - or you know
feel free to edit anything about any of the files to make them even more amazing :P

** I can't think of a description for Donnie just yet, but I totally think that should still be his name.
I'll come up with one tomorrow. 

If you think we need more stuff let me know, but I think anything else can just be reused from what you've already got. 

Thanks!
