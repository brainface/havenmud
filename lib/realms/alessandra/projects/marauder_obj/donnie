  SetLong(
     "This dude is a total badass."
     );

Donnie enjoys long walks off of short planks, moonlight hangings and scurvy.

  SetLong(
     "Donnie's pale skin is grey against the silky ebon of his hair "
     "and eyes and he moves with a dexterous grace that not many "
     "posses. His tall and lean frame give many the foolhardy a "
     "very dangerous level of confidence, which he is all too happy "
     "to shred with a quick plunge of his dagger."
     );

So lame.
