DUUK - TO DO (He swore a solemn vodka'd oath that these would get done (or looked at (probs)))

Backpacks - dest inventory on logout, cannot be worn (changed all LIB_WORN_STORAGE to LIB_STORAGE because crashes?)

Estates - set longs don't work (I don't think the descriptions save), also they sometimes exit to strange places, (Also mike wants "bigger estates" more rooms, etc.
and "savable furniture")

(Mike also said "horses" and "shapechanging" but you can ignore him because he's too awesome and can use ed.)

I want to know if it's possible to make the game stop making me type FIRST everything and just assume it.

I also want to know if it's possible to make the mud let me do multiple things at or nearly at once.. such as "drink waters" and "look at knives" 

Player owned shops - mike says they're buggy and said the words "zaxan code" and not buggy buggy but maybe sometimes works perfect and maybe crashes the server
sometimes (he's harder to get real words out of than I am)

Custom clothes tailors/armours - possible??

There's more that wants asking about.. but this is probably plenty to ask about for now


MEL - TO DO 

11/25 12:07:04 [390] <ooc> Alessandra has work for you
11/25 12:07:10 [391] Melchezidek {ooc} For me?
11/25 12:07:12 [392] <ooc> Alessandra nogs.
11/25 12:07:23 [393] Melchezidek {ooc} oh, like mud work? I saw some memory alerts last night
11/25 12:07:27 [394] Melchezidek {ooc} I should probably look into those
11/25 12:08:36 [061] Alessandra <meta> Mike wants a bug tracking system.. like moar better than what we have
11/25 12:09:07 [062] Melchezidek {meta} Lol, yeah, I thought about that awhile ago. Integrating our bug systems into like request tracker or other ticketing software
11/25 12:09:57 [063] Alessandra <meta> so that's on your think about todoing this list
11/25 12:10:00 [064] Melchezidek {meta} I don't think it would be too difficult to do, write a poller that watches the bug directory and parses the fields and then
creates a new ticket based upon those fields
11/25 12:11:10 [065] Melchezidek {meta} but... fallout
11/25 12:11:16 [066] Alessandra <meta> hahaha
11/25 12:11:38 [067] <meta> Alessandra nogs knowingly.
11/25 12:12:29 [068] Melchezidek {meta} I want to say the reason I didn't pursue the bug tracking system was because I didn't think anyone would use it
11/25 12:12:38 [069] Melchezidek {meta} which, in my defense, is very likely
11/25 12:13:54 [070] Alessandra <meta> but we are TRYING to something something
11/25 12:15:03 [071] Melchezidek {meta} okay, so if today slows down and I finish my work project (or get bored working on it) -- I'll look into some ticketing
solutions that aren't too resource intensive
11/25 12:15:25 [072] Melchezidek {meta} also, if you asshats are going to be sailing the ocean, we need to reboot more often because the ocean is a retarded memory hog
11/25 12:19:14 [073] <meta> Alessandra cannot sail anymore.. so Mike is the asshat here
11/25 12:20:43 [074] Melchezidek {meta} I'm okay with that
