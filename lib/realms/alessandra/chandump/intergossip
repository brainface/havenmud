04/05/2014 01:11:15 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] internet, turn off.
04/05/2014 01:24:56 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] what did i miss
04/05/2014 01:46:01 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] a riveting discussion about the mozilla ceo
04/05/2014 01:46:20 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i took the counties test, didnt do as good as sini cuz i did it right after waking up so im groggy and hung over but i did pretty ok
04/05/2014 01:46:47 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] #Cancel Mozilla
04/05/2014 01:46:56 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i dont know how #tags work
04/05/2014 01:47:07 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] i have tweeted once
04/05/2014 01:47:13 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] #CancelChilis
04/05/2014 01:47:16 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] it was pretty good, but once was enough
04/05/2014 01:49:07 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] among all the things you have to warn your kids not to do on the internet, there is a new one: don't make campaign contributions to overly specific things. It may come back to haunt you years later
04/05/2014 01:50:12 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] in a few generations i wonder if americans will lie about their ancestors being republican
04/05/2014 01:51:08 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ask any french person what their relatives did during ww2, the answer is never "he was a collaborator" or "he supporte d petain and vichy"
04/05/2014 01:51:40 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it is a mystery what happened to the people with the wrong opinions and their descendants. perhaps there was a second holocaust we dont know about
04/05/2014 01:51:40 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] history is not a story of progress from darkness to enlightenment, but a waving path from extreme to extreme
04/05/2014 01:52:16 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the answer in fact is almost always "he was in the resistance"
04/05/2014 01:54:10 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] try asking an american whether his great grandpa was an abolitionist or a slave owner
04/05/2014 01:54:28 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] if you go back far enough, we're all descendants of heroes and serial killers
04/05/2014 01:55:32 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] most people have a whole bunch of great grandparents, there's a good chance one of them was in the resistance
04/05/2014 01:58:15 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] pesumably thats also true of vichy suppoter great gramps
04/05/2014 01:59:05 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] you know what
04/05/2014 01:59:27 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] most people did nothing and just tried to survive
04/05/2014 02:00:15 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] sure
04/05/2014 02:05:31 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] don't mention the war
04/05/2014 02:06:03 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] it's great that the kids chose saturday morning to finally recover from the daylight saving time change
04/05/2014 02:58:15 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Maybe we could form an anti-boycotting organization to defend the rights of people to spend their money (personal or corporate) for the things they believe in, no matter how stupid or politically incorrect it might be.
04/05/2014 03:31:06 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Back in my parents' days, people who stood up for what they believed in (regardless of popular opinion) were said to be of strong conviction and character.  People who lacked this conviction were considered untrustworthy, and typically went into politics, or swindling.  Today's world of Political Correctness encourages this lack of conviction.
04/05/2014 03:48:56 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Hey Crat... you still awake?  Awake yet?  Awake again?  I guess it's what... 9am over there?
04/05/2014 03:59:57 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] about 10am
04/05/2014 04:00:56 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I wondered if you'd noticed my new domain name, which you might want to update that link you have on lpmuds.net in the next 55 days or so. :)
04/05/2014 04:02:14 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The yearly renewal came up, and I decided I was bored of the old name (and it didn't really apply to any of my projects anymore), so instead of renewing it I just got a different one.
04/05/2014 04:11:40 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] heroic serial killers?
04/05/2014 04:15:00 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] im sure i'll get around to it sometime, thx for the reminder
04/05/2014 04:24:34 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] hello
04/05/2014 04:24:41 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] good something everyone
04/05/2014 04:26:44 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Yep, no hurry... I'll try to keep the old domain pointed to the same place as the new one until it expires.
04/05/2014 04:27:28 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Right now I'm trying my DNS provider's "stealth URL forwarding" thing... lemme know if it's broken.
04/05/2014 04:28:52 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] any i3 error?
04/05/2014 04:29:53 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I don't think I3 cares... more like an error on my log page, or not being able to get to the minecraft server or muds that nobody plays. :)
04/05/2014 04:33:15 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] ah! you have a minecraft server?
04/05/2014 04:33:19 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] or... muds?
04/05/2014 04:33:42 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] :P
04/05/2014 04:34:21 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] As a matter of fact, I do. :)
04/05/2014 04:34:55 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] If you want to screw around on minecraft, just send me your minecraft username so I can add it to the whitelist.
04/05/2014 04:35:18 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] As for the mud... WileyMUD is always ready to kill people.
04/05/2014 04:35:33 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Unless it's crashed because I updated Postgres and didn't reboot it....
04/05/2014 04:36:35 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] I lost the timing of start playing minecraft, but thanks
04/05/2014 04:36:41 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] what's wiley mud theme?
04/05/2014 04:37:05 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] theme?
04/05/2014 04:37:08 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] lost interest in playing my first and only mud
04/05/2014 04:37:26 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Old school fantasy... all original.  Tries to feel like 2nd edition AD&D.
04/05/2014 04:37:26 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] so since some months now, I am trying to figure out a cool place to play
04/05/2014 04:37:41 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] even though I also enjoy just be here chatting :)
04/05/2014 04:38:07 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] It's an old school DikuMUD, so you have to enjoy the way things were back in 1993. :)
04/05/2014 04:38:20 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] yes, theme. I guess nowadays I am after a theme I enjoy, or cool systems implemented
04/05/2014 04:38:31 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] By that, I mean... it's hard and there's no mud school or other handholding mechanisms.
04/05/2014 04:38:41 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] cool :)
04/05/2014 04:38:58 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] the "hard" probably not
04/05/2014 04:39:55 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] It's mostly stable, although there's a long=standing bug it has with postgresql... I started moving a few things to SQL a while back, but it can't seem to detect when the databse conneciton dies, so it usually crashes when the next person tries to log in (and it tries to get the ban table data).
04/05/2014 04:40:14 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] I used to play t2t. in fantasy, tolkien is my main interest, and that mud is very good implementing it "realistically". it's community, though, made me leave. and I played it since 96 up to 2013
04/05/2014 04:40:16 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Since I have no players, I haven't bothered really trying to fix it.  Someday, maybe I'll revert the SQL stuff back out.
04/05/2014 04:40:45 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] why a permanent connection?
04/05/2014 04:41:13 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] you master computers more than me, but I would say that's not a good attitude
04/05/2014 04:41:28 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] the Lord of Computers would me mad with you
04/05/2014 04:41:35 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] *be
04/05/2014 04:41:52 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] My experience with perl systems taught me that establishing a connection is expensive, and produces latency.
04/05/2014 04:42:18 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] don't you host mud and database?
04/05/2014 04:42:23 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] If you already have a connection, a query can be very quick... but making a new connection usually eats a good 50ms or more just by itself.
04/05/2014 04:42:49 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] or do you keep everything in database and query it all the time?
04/05/2014 04:42:55 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Sure, but there's handshaking involved, and allocating buffers, creating a new transaction log, etc.
04/05/2014 04:43:09 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] I use database and... memory
04/05/2014 04:43:36 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Right now, it's only the message board and ban info that's in SQL.  That's as far as I got converting things before that bug cropped up and made me pause.
04/05/2014 04:43:47 -- Quixadhal@WileyMUD [intergossip] But, it seems to be working at the moment.
04/05/2014 04:44:10 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] eek. and 50ms in a log or reading board is expensive?
04/05/2014 04:44:15 -- Quixadhal@WileyMUD [intergossip] In theory, telnet awasteoftime.net 3000
04/05/2014 04:44:25 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] awasteoftime is good :)
04/05/2014 04:44:52 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Well, 50ms vs. 5ms... if I had EVERYTHING in the database, it would add up.
04/05/2014 04:45:16 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I'd probalby use a connection pool if I were to do it again.
04/05/2014 04:45:18 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] I dunno that everything in database is workable
04/05/2014 04:45:36 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] you move to another room and that means a query to database?
04/05/2014 04:45:37 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Sure it is, but it's a lot of work that currently nobody would enjoy. :)
04/05/2014 04:45:48 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] I mean, one connection plus some quetries?
04/05/2014 04:47:06 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] system I'm working on now, c++ uses sqlite as a db backend.
04/05/2014 04:47:12 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The stuff I worked on (at work) makes me think you could do it with only a small amount of caching.  RDBMS's are pretty good about caching commonly used things these days.
04/05/2014 04:47:20 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] I don't doubt it can work, I doubt about the delays. depending on the mud, to move between towns it can imply to move between like 50-100 rooms in a fast alias...
04/05/2014 04:47:33 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it's adapting wot I had done in java, where everything is in ram, but loads/saves to a db when needed.
04/05/2014 04:47:47 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] my mud does that
04/05/2014 04:48:05 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Lazy loading/unloading is pretty easy.
04/05/2014 04:48:32 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Just load the room the person is in and a few around it.  When they move, preload the next couple layers.
04/05/2014 04:48:34 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] :P did a draft with all in database... but delays were really bad, and not constant
04/05/2014 04:49:03 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] my java thing loaded the whole "mud" on reboot - didn't really take all that long.
04/05/2014 04:49:23 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] I also had the problem of connection to database breaks
04/05/2014 04:49:25 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] sorta "hard-coded" the seed room - a main thing, first room loaded...
04/05/2014 04:49:26 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] :P
04/05/2014 04:49:27 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Yeah, but I like being able to have an infinite sized wilderness. :)
04/05/2014 04:49:48 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] then all rooms attachedd to the seed room, then cascade to get everthing else
04/05/2014 04:49:59 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] But WileyMUD is just an old DikuMUD.
04/05/2014 04:50:25 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] If i hit a limit, then I'll adapte it.
04/05/2014 04:50:42 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] 4300 rooms in total.
04/05/2014 04:52:56 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] I would say you can easily have the entire mud in memory
04/05/2014 04:53:59 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] set an autosave of 10 minutes in another working thread, to save everything in database, and the maximum loss is 10 minutes...
04/05/2014 04:55:07 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that loss issue is my biggest headache now...trying to keep loss to as little as possible.
04/05/2014 04:55:24 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] WileyMUD has no OLC... so there's no particular effort involved. :)
04/05/2014 04:55:40 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and also not losing whatever "transactions" that may have crashed the system.
04/05/2014 04:55:50 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Really, I wanted to move things to SQL to make it easier to build or move to a different game driver. :)
04/05/2014 04:56:27 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i'm not actually using a "driver", since everything is compiled.
04/05/2014 04:56:46 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Well, you are... it's just that the entire thing IS the driver.
04/05/2014 04:56:56 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] You don't have a seperate mudlib :)
04/05/2014 04:56:58 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] yeah, that's always gonna be true
04/05/2014 04:57:18 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that's why I call it a mud thing.
04/05/2014 04:57:28 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I keep thinking I should just try converting DikuMUD to perl or ruby or something not C.
04/05/2014 04:57:57 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I bet it would be a LOT easier to work on (and more FUN) without the constant dreary issues of pointers and memory allocation.
04/05/2014 04:58:02 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] java! need to go. be well!
04/05/2014 04:58:02 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I'm looking for speed and small footprint, so I'll do the extra work and use C++
04/05/2014 04:58:03 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Crat++
04/05/2014 04:58:30 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] It's a text MUD.  My cell phone can probably run 12 copies of it at once.
04/05/2014 04:58:35 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Crat++ might have a small footprint, but not all that speedy.
04/05/2014 04:59:01 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] your cell phone prolly has more computing power than my PC.
04/05/2014 04:59:16 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] You do realize most cell phones are an order of magnitude more powerful than the workstations these MUD's were developed on... :)
04/05/2014 04:59:28 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] erm, way more.
04/05/2014 04:59:34 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Well, I wouldn't go that far Ninja... it's an iPhone.
04/05/2014 04:59:44 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] 8086 was about the start.
04/05/2014 04:59:57 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] my daily driver is a P4
04/05/2014 05:00:26 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I know we ran WileyMUD on a Sparc 4/110 for most of its life... I think that was a 100MHz risc CPU and 16MB of RAM.
04/05/2014 05:00:38 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] using a RAM disk for most of the complie process really speeds stuff up.
04/05/2014 05:01:12 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] my sqlite stuff...i keep data on disk, but the .db on RAM disk...it's amazing how much faster the RAM disk works.
04/05/2014 05:01:28 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] er, for .db build/INSERTs
04/05/2014 05:03:49 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Is this on a machine with a normal hard drive, or a USB thumb drive?
04/05/2014 05:04:39 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I ask, because there's a good chance a USB thumb drive will get mounted in synchronous mode (noasync).. meaning the OS won't cache disk writing for you.
04/05/2014 05:09:49 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] usb thumb drive.
04/05/2014 05:10:06 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] That's probably why the RAM disk is so much faster then.
04/05/2014 05:10:39 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] good point - I can test on a different machine, which should have this system as a backup anyway.
04/05/2014 05:10:47 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The OS is protecting you from lost data by not buffering your thumb drive... as it thinks you might unplug it at any moment without unmounting it properly. :)
04/05/2014 05:11:14 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Yeah, you should be able to modify /etc/fstab to make it async, and also be sure to set noatime.
04/05/2014 05:11:51 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] (the default is to always update the last accessed time for every file inode... huge waste of resources if you're the only one using the system)
04/05/2014 05:12:31 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] already noatime, but not async
04/05/2014 05:12:50 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] noatime is the time update, right?
04/05/2014 05:12:57 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Correct.
04/05/2014 05:13:13 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] been a while since I mucked with that stuff...was trying to quiet down my HD when I was sleeping.
04/05/2014 05:13:25 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] never did get it to sleep for more that like 6 seconds.
04/05/2014 05:15:25 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] tnx for the axync/usb suggestion - i'l research it; makes sense.
04/05/2014 05:15:42 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] just gotta make sure ubuntu 12.04 still pays attention to fstab
04/05/2014 05:15:51 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Yeah, normally the default is async, but I know for USB devices it always defaults to sync mode for safety reasons.
04/05/2014 05:16:09 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ubuntu keeps changing config type stuff around
04/05/2014 05:16:12 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Probably floppies too. :)
04/05/2014 05:16:17 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Yeah...
04/05/2014 05:16:35 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I sometimes miss good old slackware.
04/05/2014 05:16:44 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] adjust for windage.
04/05/2014 05:17:16 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] been fun hearing my cooling fans kick in as cpu usage pegs on my facebook home page.
04/05/2014 05:17:25 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] only time it does that.
04/05/2014 05:17:36 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Heh
04/05/2014 05:17:38 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] add adblock seems to be the common suggestion.
04/05/2014 05:17:42 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I bet my portal page would do it.
04/05/2014 05:18:00 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I have some javascript abuse to make cute scrolling text... eats up a lot of cpu.
04/05/2014 05:19:07 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] my server code - i need to either block sockets (which means use threads) or put a sleep() cycle in the polling loop.
04/05/2014 05:19:14 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i opted for sleep
04/05/2014 05:19:28 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The usual method is to use usleep()
04/05/2014 05:19:38 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] for testing, 2 second sleeps...for production,  0.2 seems to work rine
04/05/2014 05:19:47 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] yeah, actually I do use usleep.
04/05/2014 05:19:49 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Most DikuMUD type games want a regular "tick" time.
04/05/2014 05:20:29 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] WileyMUD, for example, uses a "tick" of 200ms... even though most events don't happen that often.
04/05/2014 05:20:49 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] yeah, that seems a good compromise.
04/05/2014 05:21:00 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] So, what you do is nab the start time at the top of the loop, deal with sockets, deal with update events, combat, etc... then see how much time you have left.
04/05/2014 05:21:09 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] and sleep for 200 - timeleft ms.
04/05/2014 05:21:36 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] exactly - that's the way it turned out here
04/05/2014 05:21:45 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] If you run over, you sleep to the next tick time and log the fact. :)
04/05/2014 05:22:16 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] apparently there are people who make a living streaming themselves playing video games
04/05/2014 05:22:38 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] there much money in that?
04/05/2014 05:22:46 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The best gig is streaming yourself "reviewing" a video game.
04/05/2014 05:22:53 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ah, yeah.
04/05/2014 05:23:14 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] gamestreaming is so popular that "twitch" (a platform ofr this stremaing) is 5th or 6th largest corporate consumer of intenret bandwidth, behind the likes of netflix and google
04/05/2014 05:23:42 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] gamers. heh.
04/05/2014 05:29:37 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] there's a professional star craft league in korea
04/05/2014 05:30:27 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] millions of people all over the world watch these tournaments
04/05/2014 05:30:50 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] because I don't enjoy watching other play games, I feel this should be banned
04/05/2014 05:32:30 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] perhaps in the future, gifted kids will be able to go to college on a star craft scholarship
04/05/2014 05:35:48 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Maybe we can make a new genre, where people watch us watching youtube videos.
04/05/2014 05:36:41 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly2IbHbPAhM
04/05/2014 05:43:52 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] thi is the first time i watch babymetal
04/05/2014 05:44:06 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i cn see i wasnt relly missing anything
04/05/2014 05:45:22 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] watching japanese cultural exports always feels a bit like watching a nasty accident scene
04/05/2014 05:46:17 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Dexter, in the future, when warfare is done remotely, you might be right.
04/05/2014 05:51:12 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] you imagine a dystopian but thankfully completely unrealistic future where wars are fought with satelite controlled drones?
04/05/2014 05:51:34 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] will never happen
04/05/2014 05:57:16 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] One thing I have to give Babymetal credit for... their shows seem to be crazy-level choreographed, and I have to respect anybody who can run around for an hour at that level of energy and not die. :)
04/05/2014 05:57:51 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Also, I think stuff like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N509ae0UUwQ is a lot more creative than our equivalent... Justin Bieber. :(
04/05/2014 06:00:09 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Actually, he's probably old now... what's this year's pointless teen the RIAA thinks is talented?
04/05/2014 06:00:27 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i heard he peed on something and mocked bill clinton
04/05/2014 06:00:43 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] maybe he's just maturing into a teabag
04/05/2014 06:00:52 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Did the secret service kill him?
04/05/2014 06:02:06 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] fuck's sake i hate weekends
04/05/2014 06:02:19 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ooo, it's the weekend now?
04/05/2014 06:02:26 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] let monday come quickly
04/05/2014 06:02:33 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] What's a weekend?
04/05/2014 06:02:54 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i love weekends when im traveling
04/05/2014 06:03:24 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Dexter, I expect a future where the very rich do thing remotely from safe places, while the other 99.999% grub in the dirt.
04/05/2014 06:03:25 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] nobody wants to pay for me to fly hoime for just one day, so they have to accept me totally slacking the whole weekend
04/05/2014 06:03:48 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] no office, no errands
04/05/2014 06:04:00 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] sux 2 b u?
04/05/2014 06:04:36 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] there's a small Maker Faire near me this weekend, 70 or so exhibits.
04/05/2014 06:04:43 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] just sleep and getting up for an hor or two and eating maybe, if i feel lik eit, then curling back up in bed with a smug satisfied grin for as long as it suits me
04/05/2014 06:04:55 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] 2 minutes, top?
04/05/2014 06:05:03 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] minimum really
04/05/2014 06:05:19 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] maybe to morrow i'll go watch a movie
04/05/2014 06:05:31 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] word to the wise, don't use the same escort service that the US SS does.
04/05/2014 06:05:34 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] maybe "Her" or that bangalore hotel whatever
04/05/2014 06:13:07 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] well i like outdoors stuff, but you can't plan that weeks in advance, because the weather is so unpredictable
04/05/2014 06:13:28 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] so this means that the weekend. that is every weekend, will be planned full
04/05/2014 06:13:35 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] because i didn't have anything planned
04/05/2014 06:13:40 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The outdoors is overrated.
04/05/2014 06:14:13 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] that's because you live in a sub polar hellscape
04/05/2014 06:14:46 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] If the outdoors were so great, why does everyone put so much effort into making indoors comfortable?
04/05/2014 06:16:00 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] if being healthy is so great, why do people put so much effort into reducing the suffering of sick people
04/05/2014 06:16:07 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Where do you keep your stuff?  Indoors.  Where do you usually sleep?  Indoors.
04/05/2014 06:16:48 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Prepare and eat your meals?  Indoors.  Watch TV?  Indoors.  Argue on the Interweb?  Indoors.
04/05/2014 06:18:33 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Seems to me that the majority of people's outdoor time is walking to and from their cars, mowing lawns, and generally doing other things they don't want to do.  With an occasionall lapse where they go fishing or sit on some beach until they get sunburnt or eaten alive by insects.
04/05/2014 06:22:47 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and what if gravity reverses
04/05/2014 06:22:55 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] if you're outdoors, you're toast
04/05/2014 06:23:47 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Cosmic rays?  That puny ozone thing won't help much... not like a nice metal roof!
04/05/2014 06:24:18 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Crat, that's the dumbest thing you've said yet...
04/05/2014 06:24:30 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] if yer indoors, ya bang yer head on the ceiling.
04/05/2014 06:24:48 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] if yer outdoors, you get a wonderful view (before you freeze or suffocate or wotever).
04/05/2014 06:25:42 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so where's yer smug NOW, mister?
04/05/2014 06:25:48 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] 8)
04/05/2014 06:26:05 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] good point
04/05/2014 06:26:57 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] outdoors there be dragons
04/05/2014 06:26:58 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] quix, some people spend a lot of waking time outdoors.
04/05/2014 06:27:18 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] soldiers on active duty, farmers, cops on a walking beat, oil field workers...
04/05/2014 06:27:19 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] dangerous nerds on bicycles
04/05/2014 06:27:30 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] lumberjacks, home construction, road crews...
04/05/2014 06:28:01 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and a goodly portion of humans outside "civilization".
04/05/2014 06:28:52 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] So... the village people?
04/05/2014 06:35:04 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] so, those baby metal girls are 14
04/05/2014 06:35:56 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The lead singer is 16, her minions are 14. :)
04/05/2014 07:07:01 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Q, how do I tell if a usb drive is mounted async or sync?
04/05/2014 07:07:30 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] supposedly the default is async, but I don't specify defaults, and "mount" doesn't gimme one or the other.
04/05/2014 07:27:46 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] If you explicitly specify "async" in the options part (after defaults, if you use it)... it should force it to async.
04/05/2014 07:28:02 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Otherwise, you'd have to find some lower level test to know for sure.
04/05/2014 07:32:37 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] assync amiriet
04/05/2014 07:33:20 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] IN theory, you could do a mount -o remount,async /foo
04/05/2014 07:33:34 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Although there are issues if /foo is really /
04/05/2014 07:34:13 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] (IE: some options work, others don't because it's hard to unmount / while live)
04/05/2014 08:11:43 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] theory borks a lot when "smart people" tell engineers what todo,
04/05/2014 08:11:58 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I've grown to distrust distro people greatly.
04/05/2014 08:12:18 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] especially for removable media.
04/05/2014 08:12:43 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but I'll add the async manually to fstab and hope the systems actually uses it
04/05/2014 08:13:05 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] instead of HAL or lv or wotever (found 'net references to "other stuff")
04/05/2014 08:43:22 -- Duuk {intergossip} Is that even english?
04/05/2014 08:46:56 -- Duuk {intergossip} Pluto is a planet again!
04/05/2014 08:47:25 -- Duuk {intergossip} Dammit nevermind.
04/05/2014 09:57:52 -- Duuk {intergossip} What do they got?  A lot of sand.  We got a hot crusta-ceon band.
04/05/2014 10:42:31 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] is mozilla even relevant anymore?
04/05/2014 10:42:42 -- Duuk {intergossip} I still use it, but it takes me forever to change.
04/05/2014 10:42:52 -- Duuk {intergossip} You guys are probably using some browser I've never heard of.
04/05/2014 10:44:35 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] mozilla is the IE6 of the modern world :(
04/05/2014 10:44:59 -- Duuk {intergossip} Is that good or bad?
04/05/2014 10:45:06 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] yep
04/05/2014 11:06:21 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] gotta love how firefox made turning off javascript such a pain.
04/05/2014 11:24:08 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] arctic panda ftw
04/05/2014 11:24:46 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] hmmm...turning off javascript didn't stop Facebook Home page from hammering my CPU.
04/05/2014 11:25:06 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] guess I'm limited to adblock
04/05/2014 12:07:43 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i kinda like firefox actually
04/05/2014 12:08:09 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i like using different profiles, some with different proxy settings
04/05/2014 12:08:16 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] you cant do that with ie or chrome
04/05/2014 12:14:51 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] I do that thing with Firefox too
04/05/2014 12:16:40 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] I've got a penetration testing profile on it that connects through a proxy and is overloaded with input fuzzing and cookie manipulation extensions, then a developer profile with lots of Javascript stuff, then a normal browsing profile with basic extensions
04/05/2014 12:37:43 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i dont even get what life is like for people that dont need different profiles
04/05/2014 12:37:54 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that probly sounds like im trolan or osmething
04/05/2014 12:38:02 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but seriously, what ind of simple lives are those
04/05/2014 12:59:18 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] "userbase".
04/05/2014 13:12:06 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] well crat, when you have smart vpns and such you don't need to manage profiles yourself
04/05/2014 13:17:22 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] and with fiddler and wireshark i can do EVERYTHING! MUHAHAHAHA
04/05/2014 13:18:10 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] yes that sounce scaleabble and convenient
04/05/2014 13:22:25 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i can't imagine the fucked up it infrastructure that would require clients to maintain that shit themselves
04/05/2014 13:22:29 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i feel for you man :(
04/05/2014 13:22:37 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] infra-what?
04/05/2014 13:22:37 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] deutchnet
04/05/2014 13:22:45 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i just usedifferent profiles for different stuff

04/05/2014 14:46:14 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] in the category 'things that make you feel old'
04/05/2014 14:46:24 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] Kurt Cobain shot himself 20 years ago
04/05/2014 15:20:33 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] who's that
04/05/2014 15:34:04 -- Dexter@Nanvaent [intergossip] gimlet, can you explain why China banned time travel ?
04/05/2014 16:06:16 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] do you really need to ask?
04/05/2014 16:06:21 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] it should be self-evident.
04/05/2014 16:12:11 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] no messing with causarity
04/05/2014 16:38:33 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i remember when cobain shot himself
04/05/2014 16:38:35 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i remember not caring
04/05/2014 16:38:54 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] "Wtf is this rape me shit"
04/05/2014 16:39:05 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] as i aged and got angstier, i appreciated it more
04/05/2014 16:39:08 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but he was already dead
04/05/2014 16:39:10 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and so was tupac
04/05/2014 16:39:51 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i remember being annoyed when cobin died
04/05/2014 16:40:12 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i was in colage and the angst all over campus was nauseating
04/05/2014 16:40:29 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I remember not caring then, pretty much like I don't care now. :)
04/05/2014 16:40:33 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] like this crunt had been the silenced voice of a generation
04/05/2014 16:42:27 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] Cobain the person was irrelevant.  Only what he represented mattered.
04/05/2014 16:42:39 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] (To the masses, at least)
04/05/2014 16:43:13 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] What did he represent?
04/05/2014 16:43:37 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Being a rich white musician, whining about how much life sucked?
04/05/2014 16:44:27 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I hate to +1 quix.... but...
04/05/2014 16:44:32 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] he must have also been your hero, quix
04/05/2014 16:44:46 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] since you without fail whine about every single thing
04/05/2014 16:48:30 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I remember thinking he should take the cock out of his mouth before he started "singing", so maybe people could understand the lyrics.
04/05/2014 16:49:21 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] What's the deal with "grunge" singers and enunciation, anyways?
04/05/2014 16:50:29 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Earlier generations of singers were able to do drugs and still make MOST of their words clear enough to sing along to...
04/05/2014 17:12:48 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] ahem... ozzy?
04/05/2014 17:13:23 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] neil young?
04/05/2014 17:13:30 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] bob dylan?
04/05/2014 17:13:38 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i think your logic is flawed
04/05/2014 17:21:45 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Yeah, I have to give you ozzy and neil.  Never much cared for Bob though.
04/05/2014 17:50:12 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] well, argo wasn't the worst movie i've seen

04/22/2014 11:10:21 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] fap
04/22/2014 11:13:42 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Heh, I'm sure you've seen this by now Salius.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov3B26h12C4
04/22/2014 11:18:59 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i have not
04/22/2014 11:19:07 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] can i listen or do i have to actually watch
04/22/2014 11:20:10 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] You can listen, but it's not as effective since you miss out on stuff like Joe wearing the Cobra commander costume.
04/22/2014 11:20:26 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] (as he takes your money for Zenimax)
04/22/2014 11:27:43 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] How come developers are so noob?
04/22/2014 11:28:35 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Wow... I didn't realize that the phasing was so bad.
04/22/2014 11:29:02 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] They made it so you can't see any player outside your own faction, AT ALL, outside the PvP area.
04/22/2014 11:29:18 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Like, they don't exist... not just that you can't attack them.
04/22/2014 11:29:35 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Even if you use the story option to play THEIR faction storyline.
04/22/2014 11:30:33 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Apparently once you complete a quest, you can't do it again... even if you group with someone else who needs it.
04/22/2014 11:30:59 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] So when THEY start it, they disappear and you're left standing in an empty room until they finish (or die).
04/22/2014 11:41:04 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] LOL, after a long quest chain, you arrive at the lair of the dreaded spider queen, fight your way into the depths of the cave, and see a huge pile of dead spider queen corpses with a half dozen farmers/bots standing there waiting for her to respawn.
04/22/2014 11:45:45 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] sali
04/22/2014 11:45:49 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i hate you

04/22/2014 11:49:51 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] why
04/22/2014 11:51:09 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] I tried to play Diablo 3
04/22/2014 11:51:15 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] after a 7 gig patch
04/22/2014 11:51:20 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it's now just an upsell for the add-on
04/22/2014 11:51:29 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] And you failed because you're a noob?
04/22/2014 11:53:19 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] OH, I see... you thought you'd get to play with your friends who are all in adventure mode because they bought the expansion, but you were too miserly and can't join them.
04/22/2014 11:53:48 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i thought i could find my way into the existing game i already own
04/22/2014 11:53:57 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] but every button just tries to make me buy the expansion
04/22/2014 11:54:17 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Did you try the big blue one that says "PLAY"?
04/22/2014 11:54:37 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i can't tell ... the whole screen is upsell
04/22/2014 11:54:56 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it's a pitiful money grab for a lackluster game
04/22/2014 11:55:04 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it hurts me on the inside
04/22/2014 11:55:12 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] and sali must pay for his crimes
04/22/2014 11:55:24 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] They have ointments for that...
04/22/2014 11:56:25 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] You just have to decide, do you want the creme or the gel based one?
04/22/2014 11:56:44 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it was easier to rd /s it
04/22/2014 11:57:39 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] just buy the expansion, it's fun
04/22/2014 11:57:49 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] fool me once
04/22/2014 11:57:54 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] once bitten
04/22/2014 11:57:55 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] etc
04/22/2014 11:57:58 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] fuck blizzard
04/22/2014 11:58:01 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Next time, remember to start with the smaller insertion first, to loosen you up.
04/22/2014 11:58:04 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] they lost me
04/22/2014 11:59:53 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] when you have to make an expansion to fix your busted ass game then charge for it?  nah
04/22/2014 12:00:14 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] the game was fixed before/without the expansion
04/22/2014 12:00:21 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] In other words, thousands of junior high school kids could figure out how to play, but Kali couldn't.  I feel much better about the state of Microsoft's code now.
04/22/2014 12:00:39 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] you're welcome to ignore the upsell ads, you just can't play Act V, Crusaders, or Adventure Mode with friends who do have the expansion
04/22/2014 12:00:43 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i chose to go no further
04/22/2014 12:01:06 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it's another Dead Island
04/22/2014 12:01:36 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] For it to be a choice, you would have had to have actually been able to play.
04/22/2014 12:01:40 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] it seems that your argument is they should've just given you the expansion for free as an apology for the game not being up to your standards last time you played it (after initial release)
04/22/2014 12:02:28 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] partly
04/22/2014 12:02:37 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The amusing thing is, they did give him most of the features of the expansion for free.
04/22/2014 12:02:49 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] they went full EA with the expansion
04/22/2014 12:02:57 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] pure money grab
04/22/2014 12:02:59 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] As you said Lyanic, the only things he can't do are Act V, adventure mode, and creating a crusader class character.
04/22/2014 12:03:16 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i also can't enjoy the game through the upsell
04/22/2014 12:03:26 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I seem to remember EQ2 doing that for EVERY SINGLE EXPANSION.
04/22/2014 12:04:00 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I especialy love how when you close EQ2, as a silver (non-subscription) member, it launches your web browser straight to their "buy me now" page.
04/22/2014 12:04:01 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i only remember the loading screen reflecting the current expansion
04/22/2014 12:04:38 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] It's a heart warming tactic, especially when your browser then restores 10 other tabs along with the advertising page they forced on you. :)
04/22/2014 12:04:57 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] sony is just as bad as EA/Activision
04/22/2014 12:06:12 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Does D3 pop up a window every hour or so asking you to upgrade to "gold" level, while playing?
04/22/2014 12:06:24 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] EQ2 does.
04/22/2014 12:06:29 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i don't know, i paid for EQ2
04/22/2014 12:06:35 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] just like i paid for diablo
04/22/2014 12:07:09 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] EQ2 claims to be free to play.
04/22/2014 12:07:30 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] D3 expansion is awesome. Even for $40 it's still many hours of gameplay.
04/22/2014 12:07:35 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Maybe if you paid for the expansion as if it were a monthly fee, you'd cut it the same level of slack you give EQ2.
04/22/2014 12:07:58 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] It is now a fun grinder instead of "Auction House: The Game"
04/22/2014 12:08:18 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i haven't played EQ2 in well over a year
04/22/2014 12:08:42 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] Diablo 3 is Blizzard's Windows 8
04/22/2014 12:08:44 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] Guess they had their money's worth out of it and with the reduced player base they grabbed some extra money for the expansion. But still, considering the hours I sank into it, still worth it.
04/22/2014 12:08:49 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] there's another Diablo III expansion in the works, supposedly
04/22/2014 12:09:10 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i'll consider it again when it's on the next gen consoles
04/22/2014 12:09:17 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it was designed for a controller anyway
04/22/2014 12:09:31 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Actually, that's a good comparison Kali.
04/22/2014 12:09:49 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Diablo 3 is much like Windows 8.  Diablo 3 after patch 2.0 is like Windows 8.1
04/22/2014 12:10:02 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] so still crappy
04/22/2014 12:10:11 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] screenshotted.
04/22/2014 12:10:14 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] at least you're making sense now
04/22/2014 12:10:21 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] don't be a sini
04/22/2014 12:10:26 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it's not becoming
04/22/2014 12:10:39 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] I don't know.. I think when they released D3 they knew they'd kill off the auction house after some time and turn on the fun mode once they made enough $$.
04/22/2014 12:10:46 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Who do I email that to now anyways?  Your new Ballmer 2.0 is quiet.
04/22/2014 12:10:51 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] The removal of the auction house was the best thing they could possibly have done to D3.  Unfortunately they fucked up the leveling system; gaining levels now makes you weaker.
04/22/2014 12:11:01 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] I think Windows 8 was an honest mistake, combined with the fact that everybody hates big changes so you'll always lose at least 1 version to that.
04/22/2014 12:11:21 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] The real reason every other version is 'crap'. Ok, and a bit of lack of drivers soon after the release.
04/22/2014 12:11:32 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] It only makes you weaker until you get reasonable gear.
04/22/2014 12:11:53 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Yes, leveling up to 70 feels horrible when you're still running around in level 50-60 gear. :)
04/22/2014 12:12:12 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] like Oblivion :(
04/22/2014 12:12:15 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] But you could get better gear without leveling up and it would be make you actually stronger instead of just getting you back up to where you were before leveling.
04/22/2014 12:12:32 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] The strongest you'll ever be in the game is at level 20
04/22/2014 12:12:40 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] You could... or you could do what everyone else does and play multiplayer.
04/22/2014 12:13:13 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i don't like multiplayer
04/22/2014 12:13:19 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] I've barely touched multiplayer, and my experiences with it were stupid and awful
04/22/2014 12:13:24 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I dunno... my wizard only does about 400K DPS.  I don't remember wading through things at level 20 like that.
04/22/2014 12:14:00 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] Easiest for me was at level 60 when everything suddenly makes a huge jump in stats. Smashed through the next 5 levels in minutes per level.
04/22/2014 12:14:25 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Of course, "wading through" is relative... on Normal, things die when they get near me even if I'm afk.  on Torment 2, I usually die.
04/22/2014 12:14:37 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] On hard. Leveled a new crusader starting @ level 1 without any gems etc
04/22/2014 12:14:38 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] At level 20 with just half your items as legendaries you can beat Torment VI like you're on easy mode.
04/22/2014 12:15:14 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] At level 50+ you need your entire equipment legendary just to stand a chance in Torment IV
04/22/2014 12:15:27 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] I didn't even bother to get past hard :P
04/22/2014 12:15:50 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Enemies gain enough power per level to make up for your new power, the new equipment you're supposed to get, plus some extra power each level to "make the game keep getting harder"
04/22/2014 12:16:24 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Multiplayer has always been the focus for these games, since Diablo 2.
04/22/2014 12:16:26 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] So even if you replace your level 10 equipment with perfectly equivalent level 20 equipment, leveling from 10 to 20 makes you weaker
04/22/2014 12:16:54 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] I only ever played D2 solo or with a friend, same so far with D3
04/22/2014 12:17:07 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Don't see the point of playing with random strangers, it doesn't add anything
04/22/2014 12:17:19 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] It just makes me feel rushed
04/22/2014 12:17:32 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] You get better loot faster. But I'm too casual to enjoy that.
04/22/2014 12:17:37 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Many people mistakenly think it's about the storyline.  Like any MMO, the storyline is there as added bonus content.  THe focus is the slot-machine drop system.
04/22/2014 12:17:44 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i'll play with friends sometimes
04/22/2014 12:18:00 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] but i prefer single player since i'm almost constantly distracted at home these days
04/22/2014 12:18:07 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] D3 isn't an MMO.  It's a single-player game with inexplicable latency problems.
04/22/2014 12:18:24 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] Does HC still require always-on?
04/22/2014 12:18:25 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Unlike other MMO's, you don't have to spend hours clearing out an annoying long dungeon only to have everything negated by a wipe.
04/22/2014 12:18:26 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] that was another full retard mistake by blizz
04/22/2014 12:18:34 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Even normal mode still requires always-on
04/22/2014 12:18:43 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] You can only do offline mode in the console version
04/22/2014 12:18:49 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] They never added it to the PC version
04/22/2014 12:19:06 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Which is the stupidest thing
04/22/2014 12:19:10 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Probably because how many PC users are NOT online 99% of the time.
04/22/2014 12:19:11 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] Fuck that.. I don't dare to play HC on this crummy unreliable network.
04/22/2014 12:19:43 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] My latency in Diablo 3 is about 5-10 times as high as in World of Warcraft
04/22/2014 12:19:59 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] It's horrible
04/22/2014 12:20:13 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] It varies for me.
04/22/2014 12:20:21 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] twss
04/22/2014 12:20:28 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I actually think it depends what server blade your game happens to get created on.
04/22/2014 12:20:34 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] I get a 1-2 second lag burst about once every minute
04/22/2014 12:20:45 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] And just a general shit connection
04/22/2014 12:21:13 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Tried a different computer, tried a different network, tried playing on motherfucking Google Fiber
04/22/2014 12:21:22 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] No difference, it's all D3
04/22/2014 12:21:36 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Not that bad for me.  I get an occasional rubber-band of a second or so, and a slight half-second lag on giant boss fights with 5000 effects flying aroudn the screen.
04/22/2014 12:22:10 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] unacceptable
04/22/2014 12:22:16 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] How often is "occasional"?
04/22/2014 12:22:18 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] for a game that should be running fully on your PC
04/22/2014 12:22:30 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] blizzard is a has-been
04/22/2014 12:22:42 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] What gets me is that I don't have that lag in WoW
04/22/2014 12:22:45 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Like I might notice it once or twice an hour.
04/22/2014 12:22:47 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] blizzard is a will-be.
04/22/2014 12:22:52 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Why isn't it just using the same servers as WoW
04/22/2014 12:23:06 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] D3 is a very different model than WoW.
04/22/2014 12:23:14 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Or at least the same quality servers
04/22/2014 12:23:35 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] In WoW, the client sends stuff to the server as events, and the server occasionally sends back results or updates.  The client does much of the work.
04/22/2014 12:23:46 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] In D3, every single click is a client/server exchange.
04/22/2014 12:23:53 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Did they just pull out their old 2003 servers from vanilla WoW and decide hey fuck D3 doesn't matter we can use this shit for it
04/22/2014 12:24:08 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] do you remember the launch?
04/22/2014 12:24:14 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] ERROR 37
04/22/2014 12:24:18 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] SO every time an ice orb spams the screen, that's a whole set of packets flying to and from the server telling you what it hit.
04/22/2014 12:24:56 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] That's why the lag is so much more obvious... the client can't predict and correct for it like WoW does.
04/22/2014 12:25:10 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the launch of ros was just about perfect
04/22/2014 12:25:26 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] there's bad lag the last few days, but it's a peering problem with at&t
04/22/2014 12:25:30 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it's lagging in wow too
04/22/2014 12:25:50 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Yep, I didn't even notice the launch, until I exited my current game and could go to act 5.
04/22/2014 12:25:50 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that said i 100% agree d3 should have had offline mode for ros :P
04/22/2014 12:26:08 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i think it's actually on the radar
04/22/2014 12:26:20 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Yeah I was so sure they were gonna take the offline mode they made for the console version, and add it to the PC version in the expansion
04/22/2014 12:26:21 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] for a patch later in 2.x
04/22/2014 12:26:28 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] I'd pay another $20 just for that
04/22/2014 12:26:34 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] offline mode would be nice.  I think the only reason they didn't allow it was to push the auction house.
04/22/2014 12:26:35 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it probably didn't make it becasuse time
04/22/2014 12:26:54 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but removing teh ah should prove more than anything that there was a huge paradigm shift
04/22/2014 12:27:19 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Now, there's really no reason not to offer it... it would lighten the load on their servers if private games ran on your own hardware.
04/22/2014 12:27:57 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i know, i'm pretty sure they plan to
04/22/2014 12:27:59 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] It would be nice if they could retain the ability to have you be online for b.net chat, and have your friends join your private game.
04/22/2014 12:28:24 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] Do people actually leave chat turned on
04/22/2014 12:28:30 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] But even if it were just a big "offline" button that cut everything, it would be a plus.
04/22/2014 12:28:35 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] even Sim City fixed their online crap
04/22/2014 12:28:36 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] I just want to delete the chat window out of the interface
04/22/2014 12:28:52 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I do, but then I have actual friends that I taunt when I see them log in.
04/22/2014 12:29:02 -- No@UOSSMUD [intergossip] That's fair
04/22/2014 12:29:37 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] well the main thing people aren't taking into account is that d3 console was basically a ground up build
04/22/2014 12:29:37 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Like my friend I haven't seen for months who logged into Hearthstone last night.  I asked if the TESO servers were down. :)
04/22/2014 12:29:38 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] not a port
04/22/2014 12:29:54 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] not smart
04/22/2014 12:29:55 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it's not trivial to remove the online play from the pc client
04/22/2014 12:30:05 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that said, the expansion would have been the right time to do it
04/22/2014 12:30:12 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] someone forgot to feed the monkeys making decisions over there
04/22/2014 12:30:15 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but i'm pretty sure most of the foundation for offline play was put in
04/22/2014 12:30:27 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] you were smart to leave when you did
04/22/2014 12:30:30 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] well console was restarted when jay wilson got "reassigned"
04/22/2014 12:30:34 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] the rats are always the smart ones
04/22/2014 12:42:50 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] One thing I do like about both blizzard and SOE... having the shared chat between all their games.
04/22/2014 12:43:56 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] SOE's version isn't as well integrated, but the idea's the same... let you talk to friends who still play OTHER games you used to.
04/22/2014 12:44:42 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Now, if only Salius still worked there... we could get him to whip up an I3->battle.net bridge for us.
04/22/2014 12:45:16 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] (There's an old perl module to talk over b.net, but it was for the older D2/Starcraft version)

04/22/2014 12:59:47 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] there's a version of that on "The Wall Work in Progress" which I like
04/22/2014 13:01:39 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] wassat?
04/22/2014 13:02:11 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] lyrics: http://www.metrolyrics.com/young-lust-band-demo-lyrics-pink-floyd.html

04/22/2014 13:02:43 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it's good
04/22/2014 13:02:59 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] "Ooooh, I need a dirty galrn rn"
04/22/2014 13:03:13 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it's Pink Floyd you might not have listened to
04/22/2014 13:03:20 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] such a discovery in this day & age
04/22/2014 13:03:32 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] OoOoOooOooooOooooOo I needs a durry wommin
04/22/2014 13:03:37 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] OooOooO I needs a durry gal
04/22/2014 13:04:42 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] hey, Iron Sky: Director's Cut on netflix :D
04/22/2014 13:05:17 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] y'know I totally skipped that
04/22/2014 13:05:19 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] this version is odd for floyd... the vocals are too loud compared to the music
04/22/2014 13:05:27 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] still good
04/22/2014 13:05:32 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] just odd
04/22/2014 13:05:37 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I actually might like it more than the original
04/22/2014 13:05:43 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i feels like it's missing something
04/22/2014 13:05:50 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] you need to digest it
04/22/2014 13:05:56 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] at first I didn't like it
04/22/2014 13:05:56 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] like it's not fully produced yet
04/22/2014 13:06:01 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] (discovered it about 6 months ago)
04/22/2014 13:06:10 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] no, probably not as well produced
04/22/2014 13:06:10 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it's not a dislike, it just feels non-sequitor
04/22/2014 13:06:26 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] also you're listening to YouTubes
04/22/2014 13:06:34 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] maybe Zune Music has it
04/22/2014 13:06:35 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] too much goo in the tubes
04/22/2014 13:06:39 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] hah
04/22/2014 13:06:41 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Spotify has it
04/22/2014 13:06:47 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] what a crap service that still is :(
04/22/2014 13:07:10 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] sporkify
04/22/2014 13:07:18 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] netflix should add music

04/22/2014 13:45:45 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] is that supposed to do something for me
04/22/2014 13:46:09 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i don't know... does it?
04/22/2014 13:46:28 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] the look on that guy's face is priceless
04/22/2014 13:47:00 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] because normally basketball players are stoic

04/22/2014 14:58:39 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i want to convert my lawn mower to propane
04/22/2014 15:01:13 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i think it'll be less work than rebuilding the carburator.
04/22/2014 15:02:50 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] buy a new one
04/22/2014 15:02:55 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] be an american
04/22/2014 15:03:58 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] http://www.allpropanemowers.com/v.php?pg=260
04/22/2014 15:04:03 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it looks every bit as simple as i thought
04/22/2014 15:04:18 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] untill you engulf yourself in a ball of fire
04/22/2014 15:05:05 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i'm pretty familiar with flammable gasses at this point.
04/22/2014 15:05:54 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it sure would be a lot nicer with the little bottles instead of the big bottles.  that's a lot of extra weight to push around
04/22/2014 15:08:13 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i like gasoline
04/22/2014 15:11:06 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i dislike gasoline
04/22/2014 15:11:31 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i'm pretty sure i can go to home depot, get a 1# bottle, a cheapo regulator, some rubber hose, and some zipties and do this
04/22/2014 15:11:46 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] *FWOOOOOM*
04/22/2014 15:11:51 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and it would probably never ever again require any maintanence.
04/22/2014 15:12:50 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the whole refilling bottles from a big bottle scares me a little bit though
04/22/2014 15:13:02 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they make smaller bottles, but they are highly expensive compared to the 'free' exchange bottle
04/22/2014 15:13:32 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i guess a 5# bottle is not too expensive
04/22/2014 15:13:37 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and i can have it filled
04/22/2014 15:15:10 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i'd prefer something i can fill from my house's natural gas line
04/22/2014 15:19:47 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] oooo
04/22/2014 15:19:48 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that's a good idea
04/22/2014 15:19:54 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i mean, the conversion would be exactly identical
04/22/2014 15:20:04 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] esp since i have NG at home
04/22/2014 15:20:10 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but you need a... concentrator?
04/22/2014 15:20:19 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] since residential NG is delivered at low pressures
04/22/2014 15:20:43 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and also it's fairly inexpensive in tx
04/22/2014 15:21:14 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] 'at 800 watts, it uses less than most small kitchen appliances'
04/22/2014 15:21:18 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i know you can get the adapters to make your gas grill work with NG
04/22/2014 15:21:21 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] fuck you, cng now
04/22/2014 15:21:28 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] yeah, you have to compensate for the btu difference
04/22/2014 15:21:36 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ng is like 1000 btu/cf
04/22/2014 15:22:09 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] propane is like 2400
04/22/2014 15:22:16 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] kerosene
04/22/2014 15:22:22 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] not readily available?
04/22/2014 15:22:29 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] white gas
04/22/2014 15:22:36 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] also i don't think it will run in a normal ICE without some additional work
04/22/2014 15:22:37 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] mother fucking sterno
04/22/2014 15:22:40 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] kerosene will run in a diesel.
04/22/2014 15:23:37 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i'm not buying an NG compressor at 4500 bucks.  f that
04/22/2014 15:23:48 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] if i had a well, sure.
04/22/2014 15:24:41 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] how big is your home ng feed?
04/22/2014 15:24:45 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] half inch at half psi?
04/22/2014 15:25:12 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] no clue
04/22/2014 15:30:47 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] poop compresser
04/22/2014 15:31:12 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] getting all yer medical things done before moving to the 3rd world?
04/22/2014 15:31:21 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] pretty much
04/22/2014 15:31:25 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] Merkelcare :(
04/22/2014 15:31:26 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i should go to the dentist
04/22/2014 15:37:41 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Where do you live Joshua?  I just want to setup a google alert so I don't miss the story about the "suspected meth lab explosion" after you get your conversion done.
04/22/2014 15:38:14 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] And yes Crat, you should go to the dentist.  You don't want to become British, do you?
04/22/2014 15:39:05 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ok, so it is just as simple as i thought
04/22/2014 15:39:15 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] no matter how much propane i applied, it wouldn't rev beyond a certain point
04/22/2014 15:39:58 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] my welding regulator is too high pressure for this application, you need very little gas.
04/22/2014 15:40:22 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that means you need zip ties, a bottle, a cheap ass grill regulator, and a bit of hose
04/22/2014 15:40:30 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] drill a hole in the filter box or fit it to one of the intakes.
04/22/2014 15:40:42 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] make sure you turn that shit off!
04/22/2014 15:40:43 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Don't forget the case of cold pills and bleach.
04/22/2014 15:59:00 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] is propane used to make drugs?
04/22/2014 15:59:22 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Does it produce flame?
04/22/2014 16:00:05 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] yes?
04/22/2014 16:00:21 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Then it can and has been used to make drugs.

04/22/2014 16:10:21 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i think this is the one.
04/22/2014 16:24:08 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] wunderbar
04/22/2014 16:27:30 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i guess if i really cared, i could use a zero governor and rig up a better connection
04/22/2014 16:33:10 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it doesn't have to be like this
04/22/2014 16:33:21 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] all we need to do
04/22/2014 16:33:23 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] is keep talking
04/22/2014 16:37:31 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] ptheven :(
04/22/2014 16:38:02 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] stuck in a web of isolation while the ivy grows over the door
04/22/2014 16:38:10 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] you know, it's as if it were a different band
04/22/2014 16:38:12 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but still good
04/22/2014 16:38:36 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] some of my favorites are on that album
04/22/2014 16:38:42 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] name a few
04/22/2014 16:38:45 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I have a 6.5 HP lawnmower I need to fix or ditch...now you got me thinking about a propane conversion too.
04/22/2014 16:39:33 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] take it back is my #1
04/22/2014 16:39:49 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] how is it broke?  fuel system?
04/22/2014 16:39:58 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] #1 of all Floyd?
04/22/2014 16:40:03 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i also like poles apart and coming back to life
04/22/2014 16:40:06 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I can't agree with that =(
04/22/2014 16:40:10 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] #1 on that album
04/22/2014 16:40:22 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] "some of my favorites are on that album"
04/22/2014 16:40:38 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] ultimate all time floyd best?  it's between wish you were here, the turning away and comfortably numb
04/22/2014 16:40:51 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] yes, i have a lot of favorite floyd songs
04/22/2014 16:40:54 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I thought you'd hate the turning away, being that you create so much of it
04/22/2014 16:41:02 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] har har
04/22/2014 16:41:06 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] only you, mon ami
04/22/2014 16:41:09 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] comfortably numb is top 5 for me

04/22/2014 16:41:34 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] yes, wywh is top 5 as well

04/22/2014 16:43:21 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] breathe in the air
04/22/2014 17:07:04 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I think the best solution is to use a zero governor and then you just have the fuel intake line going to the governor instead of the gas tank.
04/22/2014 17:22:20 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Echoes, One of These Days, Sheep, Atom Heart Mother, and Time.
04/22/2014 17:23:53 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The Atom Heart Mother suite, that is... not to be confused with the whole album. :)

04/23/2014 01:07:48 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] he could kiss you now but he'd only miss you more when he walks away
04/23/2014 01:08:06 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] he never let his heart speak through his lips;
04/23/2014 01:08:11 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] he never let his hands rest on your hips
04/23/2014 01:08:20 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] he never said "I love you", but his heart never lies
04/23/2014 01:08:26 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] you know you heard him say it when he said it with his eyes

04/23/2014 09:37:35 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Goddamnit Sini... why you keep changing the Picasa web interface to make it HARDER to get the link to a photo you have uploaded?

04/23/2014 09:48:37 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Since not being able to do that makes it pretty worthless when you want to link something in a forum or other CMS.

04/24/2014 11:30:47 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] :(
04/24/2014 11:31:11 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] why did you release garbage?
04/24/2014 11:31:28 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] actually, it's the josh clause
04/24/2014 11:31:48 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i can put some info into the system and it makes WU screw with specific people
04/24/2014 11:31:55 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] one of the little joys in my life
04/24/2014 11:32:08 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] how owuld you know which stolen VLK i was using?
04/24/2014 11:37:22 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I think I had staroffice once... tasted like chicken.

04/24/2014 12:38:19 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i guess i have to 'refresh' or 'reset' my windows installation
04/24/2014 12:38:49 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Windows h8?  You could just blow it away and install Windows 7 so things work properly.
04/24/2014 12:41:16 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] tempting
04/24/2014 12:41:23 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] esp since there will be no support if i don't install this update
04/24/2014 12:42:54 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I generally treat the latest Windows version a beta test... maybe the next full service pack will make Windows 8 stable for non-tablets.
04/24/2014 12:42:58 -- Kayle@SithWars [intergossip] Any of you aside from Mara played with ComputerCraft for minecraft?
04/24/2014 12:43:32 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I watched a video of tht giant CPU that guy built... does that count?
04/24/2014 12:44:33 -- Kayle@SithWars [intergossip] nope
04/24/2014 12:45:01 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i'm really frustrated by this fucking update thing.
04/24/2014 12:45:05 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i've pissed my morning away on this
04/24/2014 12:48:22 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] fap
04/24/2014 12:48:45 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] what is the problem with the update
04/24/2014 12:49:09 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it does not install on my desktop =( =( =(
04/24/2014 12:52:47 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i had 'trouble' with it as well which turned out to be me trying to manually scan and install the update when WU was doing the same thing in the background.  so it would spit out wierd failures
04/24/2014 12:53:02 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i also had to reboot between some other updates and the 8.1U1
04/24/2014 12:53:47 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] weird
04/24/2014 12:53:52 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i haven't installed it yet
04/24/2014 12:54:16 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but i seriously reformat like once a month
04/24/2014 12:59:57 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i tried lots of DISM sorcery
04/24/2014 13:00:02 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i think i'm done fucking with it for now
04/24/2014 13:00:07 -- Joshua@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i blame kalinash personally.
04/24/2014 13:00:20 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] I also blame him...
04/24/2014 13:00:47 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i did put in the josh trap
04/24/2014 13:16:26 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] LOL, I reformat once every 3 years or so.
04/24/2014 13:16:49 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so new versions of windows get bitchy about activation after you reformat a few times
04/24/2014 13:16:51 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I reboot once a month though.
04/24/2014 13:16:56 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so i tend to just reformat when the 30 days are up
04/24/2014 13:16:59 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] for activation
04/24/2014 13:17:07 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] on occasion i'll actually do the call in to activate thing
04/24/2014 13:17:14 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Never had that issue... but then I run Windows 7.
04/24/2014 13:17:25 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] windows 7 had activation limits too
04/24/2014 13:17:41 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] So I've heard, but I've never hit one.
04/24/2014 13:17:48 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] probably because you never reformat
04/24/2014 13:18:13 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I only reinstall my OS when I upgrade hardware, or it breaks... Win 7 has never broken.
04/24/2014 13:18:26 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] why are you activating every time you reformat? Do you actually reinstall from scratch?
04/24/2014 13:18:38 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that's silly - install once, and when it's fresh, norton ghost an image
04/24/2014 13:18:53 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that way you don't activate every time and it's actually faster
04/24/2014 13:19:07 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] Sini speaks truth
04/24/2014 13:19:39 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I used to do that... but since you still have to spend forever updating windows and fetching new drivers, it doesn't really save that much time.
04/24/2014 13:19:55 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] See also:  Why do you have to reinstall windows more than once every couple of years?
04/24/2014 13:20:27 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] IE: How are you misusing it so badly that it breaks and needs to be reinstalled?
04/24/2014 13:20:35 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] Quix also speaks truth...*slaps self*
04/24/2014 13:20:36 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] oh you
04/24/2014 13:21:59 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it does take a long time, yes, because of updates
04/24/2014 13:22:08 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but it's time you still have to spend if you reinstall from scratch
04/24/2014 13:22:17 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and there's the activation bit that you no longer have to do
04/24/2014 13:22:53 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] *shrug*  I just wonder why so many people feel they have to reinstall their OS so often.  Do you really change motherboards that frequently?
04/24/2014 13:24:50 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Over the last 5 years or so, I've upgraded my RAM, CPU and video card.  I've installed the OS twice.  The last time was becasue I wanted to switch my RAID setup.
04/24/2014 13:28:51 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] they're used to thinking of windows as windows 95
04/24/2014 13:30:11 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Ah, so they think "uninstalling" an application means reinstalling the OS and installing everything BUT that one... gotcha.
04/24/2014 13:32:10 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I've heard some people claim their system slows down over time... I haven't had that issue since Windows 98.  Maybe it's all the ads they don't block, running rogue jawascript in the background.
04/24/2014 13:34:49 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] hmm
04/24/2014 13:34:54 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] nice one sini
04/24/2014 13:50:56 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Minecraft realms, huh
04/24/2014 13:52:27 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ah, it's just hosted minecraft for 13 bucks a month
04/24/2014 14:01:26 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] There's a Hell's Kitchen video game...
04/24/2014 14:02:25 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The should make a multiplayer version, where you can try to backstab your teammates so Ramsey eats them instead of you.
04/24/2014 14:33:35 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] that would be fun
04/24/2014 14:34:54 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so how bout that ukrainey stuff

04/24/2014 14:36:31 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the world is full of countries pissed off at eachother
04/24/2014 14:36:44 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and all its going to take is one starting a fight with another for it to turn into a global fuckfest
04/24/2014 14:37:05 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] well
04/24/2014 14:37:07 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] iran and n korea are just waiting for a reason to start shit with the us
04/24/2014 14:37:19 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ok now you're totally out of your depth
04/24/2014 14:37:25 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i'm sure it's mutual :P
04/24/2014 14:37:36 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] all i'm saying is there are lots of countries flexing their war-peens at eachother
04/24/2014 14:37:46 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and as soon as one shit starts
04/24/2014 14:37:50 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] everyone is going to jump in feet first
04/24/2014 14:37:54 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] not too many have actually gained territory by invading another country
04/24/2014 14:38:00 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] thats the diff
04/24/2014 14:38:04 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] Warpeen Hammer
04/24/2014 14:38:09 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] russia made everyone's monocle pop out
04/24/2014 14:38:11 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i mean the shit like with north korea a few months back
04/24/2014 14:38:16 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] becuase they're partying like it's 1899
04/24/2014 14:38:18 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] threatening this and that

04/24/2014 14:38:35 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] seriously

04/24/2014 14:38:48 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] sorry telnet is eating words
04/24/2014 14:38:53 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] anyways if something like that happened
04/24/2014 14:39:00 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] dprk is like the armless legless knight in monty python
04/24/2014 14:39:03 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] would north korea not shoot some of their firecrackers at us just cause
04/24/2014 14:39:13 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they can threated to bump into you and bite you
04/24/2014 14:39:22 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they cant, they wont
04/24/2014 14:39:28 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they have no arms legs or dick
04/24/2014 14:39:41 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so what is the worst case here then
04/24/2014 14:39:43 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] we keep them contained, they keep threatening, business as usual
04/24/2014 14:39:51 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] dprk?
04/24/2014 14:39:54 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] russia
04/24/2014 14:39:57 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] I saw a news story last week that Kim Jong-Un's regime is losing its grip on the people, and they might start allowing some "westernization" to prevent revolt
04/24/2014 14:40:01 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] you're a dprk
04/24/2014 14:40:04 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ok what are we talking about salius
04/24/2014 14:40:06 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] do you think nato would start fight with russia
04/24/2014 14:40:13 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] or UN
04/24/2014 14:40:21 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] UN start a fight?
04/24/2014 14:40:22 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] or would it be construed as russia starting a fight
04/24/2014 14:40:24 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] jesus
04/24/2014 14:40:32 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i dont even know where to start
04/24/2014 14:40:44 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i dunno, maybe i'm taking this way out of proportion
04/24/2014 14:40:44 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] basically ww3 is out of the question
04/24/2014 14:40:54 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it seems likea  country just took land from another country
04/24/2014 14:40:57 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] start with possible global repercussions on a potential russian invasion of ukraine
04/24/2014 14:40:57 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that seems like a "big deal"
04/24/2014 14:41:03 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] start with how many pretty girls would be affected
04/24/2014 14:41:15 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the most extreme military scenario involves maybe a cupla hundred dead in an escalated skirmish
04/24/2014 14:41:23 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and that sobers everyone right the fuck up
04/24/2014 14:41:33 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] Crat whips out his Ph.D. in Armchair Politicking, take 3d12+5 damage
04/24/2014 14:41:40 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so basically putin is like bring it bitches
04/24/2014 14:41:44 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] nuclear exchange is just not in the cards
04/24/2014 14:41:46 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and obama is like ima bring it bitch
04/24/2014 14:41:51 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and putin is like do it
04/24/2014 14:41:56 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and obama is like ima do it
04/24/2014 14:41:57 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] nor is it feasible for russia to roll tanks into germany
04/24/2014 14:42:01 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] thats what it seems like i'm seeing
04/24/2014 14:42:08 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] salius do you even read
04/24/2014 14:42:17 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i watch the news while eating dinnr
04/24/2014 14:42:19 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] thats about it
04/24/2014 14:42:27 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so listen to me now
04/24/2014 14:42:41 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] there might be an accidental exchange of hostilities that escalates into a nasty skirmish
04/24/2014 14:42:54 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that's about the limit in terms of nato v russia
04/24/2014 14:43:05 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] nobody really wants a shooting war of that kind
04/24/2014 14:43:18 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ok?
04/24/2014 14:43:30 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i get that, and i don't think your logic is flawed
04/24/2014 14:43:37 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the russians cant afford a real war
04/24/2014 14:43:57 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they can afford to repress minorities with their military...cuz that's a predictable expenditure
04/24/2014 14:44:19 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] a full blown european theater war is all-bets-off and fuck this generation
04/24/2014 14:45:03 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and theyre not actually crazy. putin is just feeling insecure and wants to beat up on some wimps to feel better, and ukraine is right there and also has been talking shit, so
04/24/2014 14:45:24 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] got it?
04/24/2014 14:45:35 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] condescend much?
04/24/2014 14:45:42 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] he tasks me
04/24/2014 14:45:49 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] mercy
04/24/2014 14:46:10 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] very well, you can have him
04/24/2014 14:46:32 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I can only offer patience, but nothing substantial
04/24/2014 14:47:03 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Sali, quit blowing your top - the global landscape isn't a lower school playground where putins shove obamas
04/24/2014 14:50:13 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] like i said maybe it seems like a bigger deal than it is
04/24/2014 14:50:29 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the news is likely partially to blame for that because omg headlines
04/24/2014 14:51:22 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] well its definitely a big deal
04/24/2014 14:51:38 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] annexation of another country's land through force is super uncool
04/24/2014 14:52:35 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it's just hard to see NATO getting involved unless Russia attacked a NATO member, and I don't see Russia going there
04/24/2014 14:53:16 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they *could* do that, i mean, history is full of shit where i'd be like "well i guess they was crazier than i expected"
04/24/2014 14:53:49 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so shit *could* totally go sideways and turn into a thing where NATO does exactly what it was designed for: start punching commies
04/24/2014 14:54:08 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but i dont see a good basis for making that prediction right now
04/24/2014 14:59:16 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] gotcha
04/24/2014 15:25:39 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] All will be well as long as there are no all-destructive powers that do not depend heavily on other powers. In that regard, I don't think we need to fear the Russian commies.
04/24/2014 15:27:07 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] I see them more as has-beens that try to play with the big boys to boost inland morale.
04/24/2014 15:28:35 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] You should rather be scared of other powers that are relatively quiet while heavily investing in technology and self-sufficiency.
04/24/2014 15:46:37 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] WW3 will start when the USA tries to tax Walmart.
04/24/2014 15:46:55 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] About Ukraine... ROFLMAO.
04/24/2014 15:48:27 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] You know, they could have joined up with NATO.  Then we'd have been like "No, no, Putin.  No dessert for you!"  But, they didn't... so if they can't maintain their own soverignty, maybe they don't deserve it.
04/24/2014 15:57:36 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] doesn't russia have a huge military?
04/24/2014 15:57:45 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] or do they just have a huge country
04/24/2014 15:58:04 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] They have an adequate military... not as big as they tried to make everyone think back in the USSR days.
04/24/2014 15:58:47 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] They used to march troops around from one city to another so our satellites would see them in EVERY major city.
04/24/2014 16:02:46 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] So, McDonald's supposedly is redoing their mascot (Ronald)...
04/24/2014 16:03:30 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it's not supposed
04/24/2014 16:03:45 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Let's hope it ends up more like this, http://www.bbcicecream.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mcDonald-Japan.jpg , and not like this, http://www.tofugu.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/01_imlovinit.jpg
04/24/2014 16:04:39 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] russia does have a huge military
04/24/2014 16:04:47 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and theyre pretty srs
04/24/2014 16:04:59 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Red Dawn
04/24/2014 16:05:02 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] their problems are around equipment maintenance and morale
04/24/2014 16:05:29 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but they can whip up a hell of a first line of combat if they need to
04/24/2014 16:06:56 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] vodka is all they need
04/24/2014 16:07:35 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] And some of them hot Ukrainian hookers!

04/24/2014 16:10:59 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] MSFT owns the bi.ng domain - they should make a short URLer out of it
04/24/2014 16:12:43 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] they have the 'binged.it' one
04/24/2014 16:16:25 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] for when people need to URLinate
04/24/2014 16:25:34 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] binged.it doesn't seem to be a short URLer
04/24/2014 16:25:49 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] both that and bi.ng redirect you to bing.com
04/24/2014 16:25:53 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] just sayin

04/24/2014 16:34:50 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] why is terrorist cell service non existent ?
04/24/2014 16:38:20 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] harder for the nsa to snoop on your conversations with concrete in the wya
04/24/2014 16:38:43 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] Because if people yap in their cell phones in the subway, crime rates will soar.
04/24/2014 16:39:03 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] because cells can't survive in a vacuum (tube)
04/24/2014 16:42:29 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] PS. I heart NYC
04/24/2014 17:19:29 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Small engine question for you guys... I have a 20 year old lawn mower I was just gifted.  It appears to be in reasonable shape, but hasn't been used in over 10 years.  4-cycle, so seperate oil and gas tanks.  The oil tank has a bit of black sludge which was probably oil once... what's the easiest way to clean that out without taking the engine apart?
04/24/2014 17:29:00 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] nanites
04/24/2014 17:38:02 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] "Hey, neighbor, I heard you were good with mechanics.."
04/24/2014 17:38:12 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] "Don't you see?  This is for YOUR benefit!  I had to cut my legs off to make it easier to fit the spoons in!" -- http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/9083-The-Elder-Scrolls-Online-We-Can-MMO-Too
04/24/2014 17:39:25 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] oro?  *watches*
04/24/2014 17:43:25 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] *giggles*
04/24/2014 17:43:26 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] LOL, nice try Styxx... my neighbors are almost as inept at mechanical activities as I am.  All hail the glorious subdivision!
04/24/2014 17:53:28 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] There's a Farmville 2?  Now that you've saved the lost brown cow, do you have to butcher it and get it to McDonald's before it rots?
04/24/2014 17:55:19 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] heh
04/24/2014 17:55:41 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] I'd be more inclined to play that one
04/24/2014 17:56:05 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] (but I won't touch it with a 10-foot pole because lol facebook games)
04/24/2014 18:22:04 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] dunno about the lawnmower, Q - my suggestion would be fill it with fresh oil, run it for a few minutes to heat the oil (no load), then drain and refill.
04/24/2014 18:22:27 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] there's prolly oil additives used to help dissolve sludge, but I've never used them in a lawnmower.
04/24/2014 18:23:00 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] fwiw, my troybilt rototiller (8hp engine) sat in my closet for like 30 years before I gave it away.
04/24/2014 18:23:28 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] next guy cleaned the carb a bit, used some diethyl ether in the carb, and the beast fired up, and has been working fine.
04/24/2014 18:23:38 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I think they topped the oil a bit.
04/24/2014 18:24:39 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] my 6.5 hp mower stopped working 1.5 years ago. gonna try and get it running this year, or ditch it.
04/24/2014 18:25:13 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it's got big back wheels, and regular small front ones, and can be set to "self propelled"...kinda neat machine, but it's also heavy.
04/24/2014 18:34:00 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Heh, thanks anti-vaccers!  Doctors are having to be re-trained to handle measels, since many of them have never seen the disease before.
04/24/2014 18:34:42 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] poor Doctors - they're so pooly paid already that the extra work surely must stretch their limits
04/24/2014 18:38:10 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] From what I've heard, unless you're a specialist, they are pretty poorly paid compared to the hours they have to put in.  Lawyer is the career to make the big bucks these days.
04/24/2014 18:38:45 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Most of the Doctors' money has to go into malpractice insurace.
04/24/2014 19:05:51 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Today marks the 99th anniversary of the Armenian genocide
04/24/2014 19:05:56 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] =(
04/24/2014 19:20:11 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] STOP CENSORSHI
04/24/2014 20:47:42 -- [intergossip] Qwer@Archipelago listens to onestop.mid again.
04/24/2014 13:19:39 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I used to do that... but since you still have to spend forever updating windows and fetching new drivers, it doesn't really save that much time.
04/24/2014 13:19:55 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] See also:  Why do you have to reinstall windows more than once every couple of years?
04/24/2014 13:20:27 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] IE: How are you misusing it so badly that it breaks and needs to be reinstalled?
04/24/2014 13:20:35 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] Quix also speaks truth...*slaps self*
04/24/2014 13:20:36 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] oh you
04/24/2014 13:21:59 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it does take a long time, yes, because of updates
04/24/2014 13:22:08 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but it's time you still have to spend if you reinstall from scratch
04/24/2014 13:22:17 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and there's the activation bit that you no longer have to do
04/24/2014 13:22:53 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] *shrug*  I just wonder why so many people feel they have to reinstall their OS so often.  Do you really change motherboards that frequently?
04/24/2014 13:24:50 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Over the last 5 years or so, I've upgraded my RAM, CPU and video card.  I've installed the OS twice.  The last time was becasue I wanted to switch my RAID setup.
04/24/2014 13:28:51 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] they're used to thinking of windows as windows 95
04/24/2014 13:30:11 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Ah, so they think "uninstalling" an application means reinstalling the OS and installing everything BUT that one... gotcha.
04/24/2014 13:32:10 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I've heard some people claim their system slows down over time... I haven't had that issue since Windows 98.  Maybe it's all the ads they don't block, running rogue jawascript in the background.
04/24/2014 13:34:49 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] hmm
04/24/2014 13:34:54 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] nice one sini

04/24/2014 14:01:26 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] There's a Hell's Kitchen video game...
04/24/2014 14:02:25 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] The should make a multiplayer version, where you can try to backstab your teammates so Ramsey eats them instead of you.
04/24/2014 14:33:35 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] that would be fun
04/24/2014 14:34:54 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so how bout that ukrainey stuff
04/24/2014 14:35:04 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ww3 inc

04/24/2014 14:37:25 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i'm sure it's mutual :P
04/24/2014 14:37:36 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] all i'm saying is there are lots of countries flexing their war-peens at eachother
04/24/2014 14:37:46 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and as soon as one shit starts
04/24/2014 14:37:50 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] everyone is going to jump in feet first
04/24/2014 14:37:54 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] not too many have actually gained territory by invading another country
04/24/2014 14:38:00 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] thats the diff
04/24/2014 14:38:04 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] Warpeen Hammer
04/24/2014 14:38:09 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] russia made everyone's monocle pop out

04/24/2014 14:38:48 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] sorry telnet is eating words
04/24/2014 14:38:53 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] anyways if something like that happened
04/24/2014 14:39:00 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] dprk is like the armless legless knight in monty python
04/24/2014 14:39:03 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] would north korea not shoot some of their firecrackers at us just cause
04/24/2014 14:39:13 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they can threated to bump into you and bite you
04/24/2014 14:39:22 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they cant, they wont
04/24/2014 14:39:28 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they have no arms legs or dick
04/24/2014 14:39:41 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so what is the worst case here then
04/24/2014 14:39:43 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] we keep them contained, they keep threatening, business as usual

04/24/2014 14:39:54 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] russia
04/24/2014 14:39:57 -- Lyanic@7thplane [intergossip] I saw a news story last week that Kim Jong-Un's regime is losing its grip on the people, and they might start allowing some "westernization" to prevent revolt
04/24/2014 14:40:01 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] you're a dprk
04/24/2014 14:40:04 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ok what are we talking about salius
04/24/2014 14:40:06 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] do you think nato would start fight with russia
04/24/2014 14:40:13 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] or UN
04/24/2014 14:40:21 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] UN start a fight?
04/24/2014 14:40:22 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] or would it be construed as russia starting a fight
04/24/2014 14:40:24 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] jesus
04/24/2014 14:40:32 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i dont even know where to start
04/24/2014 14:40:44 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i dunno, maybe i'm taking this way out of proportion
04/24/2014 14:40:44 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] basically ww3 is out of the question
04/24/2014 14:40:54 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it seems likea  country just took land from another country
04/24/2014 14:40:57 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] start with possible global repercussions on a potential russian invasion of ukraine
04/24/2014 14:40:57 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that seems like a "big deal"
04/24/2014 14:41:03 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] start with how many pretty girls would be affected
04/24/2014 14:41:15 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the most extreme military scenario involves maybe a cupla hundred dead in an escalated skirmish
04/24/2014 14:41:23 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and that sobers everyone right the fuck up

04/24/2014 14:41:40 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so basically putin is like bring it bitches
04/24/2014 14:41:44 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] nuclear exchange is just not in the cards
04/24/2014 14:41:46 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and obama is like ima bring it bitch
04/24/2014 14:41:51 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and putin is like do it
04/24/2014 14:41:56 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and obama is like ima do it
04/24/2014 14:41:57 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] nor is it feasible for russia to roll tanks into germany
04/24/2014 14:42:01 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] thats what it seems like i'm seeing
04/24/2014 14:42:08 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] salius do you even read
04/24/2014 14:42:17 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i watch the news while eating dinnr
04/24/2014 14:42:19 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] thats about it
04/24/2014 14:42:27 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so listen to me now
04/24/2014 14:42:41 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] there might be an accidental exchange of hostilities that escalates into a nasty skirmish
04/24/2014 14:42:54 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] that's about the limit in terms of nato v russia
04/24/2014 14:43:05 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] nobody really wants a shooting war of that kind
04/24/2014 14:43:18 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] ok?
04/24/2014 14:43:30 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] i get that, and i don't think your logic is flawed
04/24/2014 14:43:37 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the russians cant afford a real war
04/24/2014 14:43:57 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they can afford to repress minorities with their military...cuz that's a predictable expenditure
04/24/2014 14:44:19 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] a full blown european theater war is all-bets-off and fuck this generation
04/24/2014 14:45:03 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and theyre not actually crazy. putin is just feeling insecure and wants to beat up on some wimps to feel better, and ukraine is right there and also has been talking shit, so
04/24/2014 14:45:24 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] got it?
04/24/2014 14:45:35 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] condescend much?
04/24/2014 14:45:42 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] he tasks me
04/24/2014 14:45:49 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] mercy
04/24/2014 14:46:10 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] very well, you can have him
04/24/2014 14:46:32 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I can only offer patience, but nothing substantial
04/24/2014 14:47:03 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Sali, quit blowing your top - the global landscape isn't a lower school playground where putins shove obamas
04/24/2014 14:50:13 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] like i said maybe it seems like a bigger deal than it is
04/24/2014 14:50:29 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] the news is likely partially to blame for that because omg headlines
04/24/2014 14:51:22 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] well its definitely a big deal
04/24/2014 14:51:38 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] annexation of another country's land through force is super uncool
04/24/2014 14:52:35 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it's just hard to see NATO getting involved unless Russia attacked a NATO member, and I don't see Russia going there
04/24/2014 14:53:16 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] they *could* do that, i mean, history is full of shit where i'd be like "well i guess they was crazier than i expected"
04/24/2014 14:53:49 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] so shit *could* totally go sideways and turn into a thing where NATO does exactly what it was designed for: start punching commies
04/24/2014 14:54:08 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but i dont see a good basis for making that prediction right now
04/24/2014 14:59:16 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] gotcha
04/24/2014 15:25:39 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] All will be well as long as there are no all-destructive powers that do not depend heavily on other powers. In that regard, I don't think we need to fear the Russian commies.
04/24/2014 15:27:07 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] I see them more as has-beens that try to play with the big boys to boost inland morale.
04/24/2014 15:28:35 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] You should rather be scared of other powers that are relatively quiet while heavily investing in technology and self-sufficiency.
04/24/2014 15:46:37 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] WW3 will start when the USA tries to tax Walmart.
04/24/2014 15:46:55 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] About Ukraine... ROFLMAO.
04/24/2014 15:48:27 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] You know, they could have joined up with NATO.  Then we'd have been like "No, no, Putin.  No dessert for you!"  But, they didn't... so if they can't maintain their own soverignty, maybe they don't deserve it.
04/24/2014 15:57:36 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] doesn't russia have a huge military?
04/24/2014 15:57:45 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] or do they just have a huge country
04/24/2014 15:58:04 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] They have an adequate military... not as big as they tried to make everyone think back in the USSR days.
04/24/2014 15:58:47 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] They used to march troops around from one city to another so our satellites would see them in EVERY major city.
04/24/2014 16:02:46 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] So, McDonald's supposedly is redoing their mascot (Ronald)...
04/24/2014 16:03:30 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it's not supposed
04/24/2014 16:03:45 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Let's hope it ends up more like this, http://www.bbcicecream.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mcDonald-Japan.jpg , and not like this, http://www.tofugu.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/01_imlovinit.jpg
04/24/2014 16:04:39 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] russia does have a huge military
04/24/2014 16:04:47 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] and theyre pretty srs
04/24/2014 16:04:59 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Red Dawn
04/24/2014 16:05:02 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] their problems are around equipment maintenance and morale
04/24/2014 16:05:29 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] but they can whip up a hell of a first line of combat if they need to
04/24/2014 16:06:56 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] vodka is all they need
04/24/2014 16:07:35 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] And some of them hot Ukrainian hookers!

04/24/2014 16:10:59 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] MSFT owns the bi.ng domain - they should make a short URLer out of it
04/24/2014 16:12:43 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] they have the 'binged.it' one
04/24/2014 16:16:25 -- Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] for when people need to URLinate
04/24/2014 16:25:34 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] binged.it doesn't seem to be a short URLer
04/24/2014 16:25:49 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] both that and bi.ng redirect you to bing.com

04/24/2014 16:34:50 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] why is terrorist cell service non existent ?
04/24/2014 16:38:20 -- Salius@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] harder for the nsa to snoop on your conversations with concrete in the wya
04/24/2014 16:38:43 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] Because if people yap in their cell phones in the subway, crime rates will soar.
04/24/2014 16:39:03 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] because cells can't survive in a vacuum (tube)
04/24/2014 16:42:29 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] PS. I heart NYC
04/24/2014 17:19:29 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Small engine question for you guys... I have a 20 year old lawn mower I was just gifted.  It appears to be in reasonable shape, but hasn't been used in over 10 years.  4-cycle, so seperate oil and gas tanks.  The oil tank has a bit of black sludge which was probably oil once... what's the easiest way to clean that out without taking the engine apart?
04/24/2014 17:29:00 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] nanites
04/24/2014 17:38:02 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] "Hey, neighbor, I heard you were good with mechanics.."

04/24/2014 17:43:25 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] *giggles*
04/24/2014 17:43:26 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] LOL, nice try Styxx... my neighbors are almost as inept at mechanical activities as I am.  All hail the glorious subdivision!
04/24/2014 17:53:28 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] There's a Farmville 2?  Now that you've saved the lost brown cow, do you have to butcher it and get it to McDonald's before it rots?
04/24/2014 17:55:19 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] heh
04/24/2014 17:55:41 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] I'd be more inclined to play that one
04/24/2014 17:56:05 -- Ardneh@Ardneh's World [intergossip] (but I won't touch it with a 10-foot pole because lol facebook games)
04/24/2014 18:22:04 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] dunno about the lawnmower, Q - my suggestion would be fill it with fresh oil, run it for a few minutes to heat the oil (no load), then drain and refill.
04/24/2014 18:22:27 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] there's prolly oil additives used to help dissolve sludge, but I've never used them in a lawnmower.
04/24/2014 18:23:00 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] fwiw, my troybilt rototiller (8hp engine) sat in my closet for like 30 years before I gave it away.
04/24/2014 18:23:28 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] next guy cleaned the carb a bit, used some diethyl ether in the carb, and the beast fired up, and has been working fine.
04/24/2014 18:23:38 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] I think they topped the oil a bit.
04/24/2014 18:24:39 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] my 6.5 hp mower stopped working 1.5 years ago. gonna try and get it running this year, or ditch it.
04/24/2014 18:25:13 -- Ninja@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] it's got big back wheels, and regular small front ones, and can be set to "self propelled"...kinda neat machine, but it's also heavy.
04/24/2014 18:34:00 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Heh, thanks anti-vaccers!  Doctors are having to be re-trained to handle measels, since many of them have never seen the disease before.
04/24/2014 18:34:42 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] poor Doctors - they're so pooly paid already that the extra work surely must stretch their limits
04/24/2014 18:38:10 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] From what I've heard, unless you're a specialist, they are pretty poorly paid compared to the hours they have to put in.  Lawyer is the career to make the big bucks these days.
04/24/2014 18:38:45 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Most of the Doctors' money has to go into malpractice insurace.

04/25/2014 11:12:37 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] We.ve heard Google has not yet decided what to do with the teams not going to Android, and that Google+ is not .officially. dead, more like walking dead: .When you fire the top dog and take away all resources it is what it is.. It will take copious amounts of work for it to un-zombie, if that.s even a possibility.
04/25/2014 11:13:05 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i didn't even know google+ was still a thing
04/25/2014 11:13:11 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] isn't it like google reader?
04/25/2014 11:13:15 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] not yet

04/25/2014 12:04:52 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I would have use cardboard.... much easier to work with.

04/25/2014 12:07:37 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Europe is pretty small... I'm sure we could just walk for an hour or two until we hit and edge.
04/25/2014 12:07:45 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] pretty much, yeah
04/25/2014 12:08:12 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] doesn't matter... europe is pittering out and will cease to be a problem for us in the next decade or so

04/25/2014 12:34:45 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] What about it?
04/25/2014 12:34:48 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i prefer pecan
04/25/2014 12:36:13 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] If you want something fun... buy a raspberry pi and a working vt220 terminal, and put the pi inside the vt220, using the vt terminal as the console.
04/25/2014 12:37:03 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Should be easy enough, and just mount an rj45 jack on the back near the keyboard connector, so you can have ethernet access directly.
04/25/2014 12:37:36 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Slap a little SSD in too, and it's a self contained server. :)
04/25/2014 12:37:55 -- Viriato@Iberia MUD [intergossip] well... 40% fun, 60% a working server

04/25/2014 12:51:12 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I miss my 14.4K supra modem.
04/25/2014 12:51:55 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Used it in the dorms... had to unscrew the ancient rotary phone from the wall and wire up an rj11 to the bare wires.
04/25/2014 12:52:34 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] But it was fun to call up the university sysadmins (on a second phone line) and tell them they were lying about the speed of the modem you were on.
04/25/2014 12:53:28 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] "No, you screwed up and set the 16.8K rack in compatibilty mode again... my modem clearly shows only a 9600 baud connection and no compression"

04/25/2014 13:09:16 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] Obama: Yes. As I stated during my visit to Google on November 14, I will take a backseat to no one in my commitment to network neutrality. The Internet is the most open network in history. We have to keep it that way.
04/25/2014 13:09:36 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] I will prevent network providers from discriminating in ways that limit the freedom of expression on the Internet. Because most Americans have a choice of only one or two broadband carriers, carriers are tempted to impose a toll charge on content and services, discriminating against Web sites that are unwilling to pay for equal treatment.

04/25/2014 13:29:52 -- Styxx@Split Infinity [intergossip] Even with net neutrality laws in place (such as in NL), it's still possible for ISP's to refuse to peer with content providers such as netflix. Grrr.

04/25/2014 13:41:57 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] When you say "refuse to peer", do you mean they block netflix entirely?

04/25/2014 13:42:21 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Because if you mean "refuse to give netflix packets priority", that *IS* net neutrality.
04/25/2014 13:42:56 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] i set my router qos to give priority to media streams
04/25/2014 13:43:12 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] the choice should be mine and mine alone!
04/25/2014 13:43:19 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] OBAMA FUCKING PROMISED US
04/25/2014 13:43:28 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] That's nice Kali.... too bad your ISP ignores (and probably strips) those QoS bits so it doesn't matter much.
04/25/2014 13:43:46 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] it matters to my wireless bandwidth in the house
04/25/2014 13:44:08 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] my wife uploading photos doesn't kill my steams now
04/25/2014 13:44:18 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] IE: when your ISP's pipe to you is full, things still slow down no matter how you process things on your end.
04/25/2014 13:44:46 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Of course, you can limit yourself to less than they give you, and help keep that from happening too often. :)
04/25/2014 13:46:46 -- Sinistrad@Dead Souls Dev [intergossip] Obama did indeed promise us

04/25/2014 13:53:33 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] no one said US troops
04/25/2014 13:54:06 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] That was implied by "we"... unless you're a Europer like Crat now?

04/25/2014 14:21:56 -- Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intergossip] yep

04/25/2014 14:22:08 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] I think we should handcuff the students when they enter the building... they might kill one another by fisticuffs.
04/25/2014 14:23:48 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Ideally, they should be shackled, stripped naked, and if they fall asleep in class, the teacher should have a pressure hose at their disposal.  Our government approves of waterboarding, so surely a non-fatal fire hose would be perfectly acceptable.
04/25/2014 14:25:12 -- Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intergossip] Of course, every school will have to hire a TSA employee to monitor the surveillance cameras, since when anyone ELSE looks at naked children, it's a crime.
