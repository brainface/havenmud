swashbuckler as musketeer type

"<Name here> is the epitome of the nobler of swashbuckling types. "
"Brown wavy hair is perfectly coiffed to his shoulders and his chin "
"beard is impeccably trimmed. Beneath the carefully curled ends of "
"his mustache he smirks. Yes, <name here> is just the sort of fellow "
"who gets all the fair maidens and puts those chaps who fancy "
"themselves decent with a blade to shame. Perhaps he could teach "
"you his ways."


clothing:
hat
tabard (this includes a shirt desc because I am lazy)
leggings
boots

I didn't make a weapon because I suck at weapon descs... and I
didn't make a real file for the dude because I imagine you can just 
smack that desc right into (a copy of a style trainer you already have 
sitting in the Averath dir) I also couldn't think of a name... or if you 
even wanted him to have a real name... so yeah, I kind of did fuck 
all. You're welcome?

there's already an averian porthos... so keep with the theme and say aramis?
