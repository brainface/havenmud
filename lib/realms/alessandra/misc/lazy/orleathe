Orleathe (the one who trains)

Thick black markings line Orleathe's face, much like the scars his toned
body wears, so many badges of pride, bravery and fierceness. His wild
black hair is held back carelessly with thin leather strips, but his stance
is composed, the stance of a man well versed in combat. Biceps rippling,
he handles his weapons with the ease that can only come from true proficiency.

Leggings: 
Short: Well worn leggings
Long: The supple leather of these well worn leggings has been stitched 
together meticulously. Though worn and frayed in patches from too many days
of hard use, they appear to still offer moderate protection.

Arm Band: (a long glove? like the snake_amulet)
Short: a leather arm band
Long: Thick leather straps wrap around the wearer's arm in a band and
tie in a knot. It seems to serve no real purpose but to showcase the 
bulging (or lack of) arm muscles of the wearer.
