Spell Ideas for Soirin


Stat Boosting:

Beauty (or beautify) - faith/enchant – low to mid

Like planar strength/durability, raises charisma for a period of time. 
This would be a smaller increase than planar spells. Basically vanity 
for most clerics, but they would be sought out by bards, for this. 


Divine Wisdom - faith/enchant  - mid

Or something similar also like the planar spells, but would give a boost 
to WIS (since DE are lacking there) Would also be a lesser increase, 
but good enough to warrant use. 


Charm/Peace:

Enrapture - faith/enchant - mid to high

Basically seduces another player into not attacking/stealing/bumping. 
no aggressive actions – towards you for a period of time. Added random 
emotes making the person grovel at your feet/swoon/flirt/be all lovesick 
and sappy etc.


Offensive:

Random Damage spell  - high
Something else random - Mid

Shield:

Mesmerizing Aura - faith/enchant - mid to high

Uses up a regular shield slot – Offers no actual protection but 
increases the opponents chance to miss. Basically a daze effect. Can
only have one on at a time - Not stackable.
