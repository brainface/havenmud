You look at yourself.
You look over the graceful flowing-haired female elf.
Anouk is a slender, delicate looking elven woman who seems quite out of place
with the scabbarded weapons strapped to her back. Her skin is the colour of
pearls, and dark hair cascades down her back, shimmering with red highlights.
Her smouldering grey eyes hold hidden truths, and an intense determination.
Though she is well trained in the arts of combat.. she carries herself as a
gentle elven noble. She radiates, a glowing aura seemingly about her.
You are wearing a red shawl. 
You look to be of stature.
You look to be smooth-skinned, gray-eyed, mystical-eyed and dark-haired.
You are in top shape.

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

After a long and dizzy journey you suddenly stop.
As you look around you recognize that you are floating in a chilly void...
The only thing that you see is a little wooden door near to you.
(For OOC access give @yourname below.)
You knock on the door and an old voice snarls at you:
'Who stands at the door?' juilet
The old voice becomes more kindly: 'Ahh, err...A new one!!!'

The old voice asks curiously: 'Are you sure that this is your real name ?'
'The Creators of this Realm don't like offensive names.'
(yes/no):yes
The old voice says: 'Err... uhm...'
'Choose a magical keyword of at least 5 letters...' aless

'Errr... can you tell me again? I am very old and maybe deaf a little...'  aless


The door swings up with a loud THUMPPP and you find yourself suddenly in a
little room. You see a very very old man who stares at you and snarls:
'Uhmm... err... I don't see clearly... Are you male or female?' female

Over The Void
You stand in an unrealistic chamber. Somewhere over the void yet on solid
ground. You see doorframes of different types, some odd, some just ordinary.
The whole place looks very odd with these standing doorframes but no walls at
all. You surely could walk around the doorframes but as you look at them
reality seems to be twisted, and it is very hard to watch longer. They
seemingly lead into some different dimensions or to nowhere at all. Strangely
you see no walls and the vast space makes you shiver.... still as you look
through the door frames you see shimmering light and hear distant noises. As
you look upwards you see an octagonal shaped strange pulsing doorframe, but
there is nothing behind as you look through it. It is dimly lit here. 
There are five obvious exits: elf, half-elf, dwarf, human and gnome.
You can enter the octagonal door.
> enter octagonal door
A small demon hops before you and bars your way, saying: Remember to register
yourself, if this is not your first character!
Having said that, the demon disappears, and you get the feeling it won't bother
you again should you try to pass...
> register
You tell the demon that you want to register.
Tell me the name of one of your experienced adventurers:
For help on this room, type 'help here'.

Please type the password of anouk.

Ok, you have been registered, plese quit with your other character now.
Hit <enter> after the other character has quited.
Alright, you have been linked with anouk now you may enter the octagonal door.

Out Of Game: Patience patience patience!


Ethereal plane. 
You are floating somewhere in a strange magical field. Everything constantly
changes its shape which makes you a bit nervous. As you think of something its
picture begins to slowly form... You think everything is possible here... For a
second you think you heard something that is strange considering you are a
spirit. Maybe you should listen to it. It is dimly lit here. 

> listen
As you listen carefully...
You hear a clear weak voice singing louder and louder.

> 
 
                  Even
               spirits have
        a way to sense their fate
   Choose your fate choose your destiny
        Use your imagination or be
              trapped forever
                and ever...
                  
...and the voice fades to nothing...

> sense
You sense many entities trying to drive your thoughts...


> 
Snakemen! You should choose Parduks.. Orcs are the best! Ogres! Nymphs! 
Be Merman or be square! Be Lizardman or be square! Kobolds! Be Kenku! 
Be Human or be square! Be Halfling or be square! 
Choose Half-orcs! You should choose Half-ogres.. Only Half-elves know.. 
Goblins! Gnomes rule! Giants are the best! Faeries rule! Be Elf! 
You should choose Dwarves.. Duergars rule! Be Dryad! Drows are the best! 
Be Centaur or be square! You should choose Bugbears.. Only Brownies know.. 
You should choose Aarakocras.. 

You think it would be better to concentrate on the different voices first.
...before choosing any of them...


> choose dryad
You hear as the voices shriek in rage: Noooooo!
> 
Suddenly you are dragged away...

Ethereal plane. 
You are in an endless hall which stretches in all directions. There are no
walls at all only the ground is solid... When you look up (or is it down?) only
a low dim light can be seen... There are dozens of crystal globes floating all
around in various sizes and colours. Most of them are beyond your reach because
moving here is limited for you somehow. You also notice a strange shimmering
mirror close to you... It is dimly lit here. 

You feel an intense presence closing in on you.
And hear a voice from very close:
      I knew you would choose to be a dryad!

      You've chosen your fate now choose your shape...
      Look at the globes, each holds different traits.
      Choose wisely because you are entitled to live with
      them for your whole life...
...and the voice silences...

> l mirror
You look at the mirror.
Looking at the mirror you see:
A shapeless dryad

> l globes
You look at the globes.
As you look at the globes more carefully you see a few of them a bit closer to
you. You can see a globe of eyes, a globe of skins, a globe of noses, a globe
of ears, a globe of hairs, a globe of physique and a globe of faces.
> l globe of eyes
As you look at the globe of eyes closer you sense the following traits you
could inherit...
You think your eye could take a shape of: slant-eyed, squint-eyed, cross-eyed,
round-eyed, one-eyed, glazed-eyed, watery-eyed, sunken-eyed, fish-eyed,
staring-eyed, shining-eyed, gentle-eyed, glittering-eyed, hypnotic-eyed,
mystical-eyed, gleaming-eyed.
You think your eye could take a colour of: black-eyed, blue-eyed, brown-eyed,
gray-eyed, green-eyed, coppery-eyed, bright-eyed, hazel-eyed, silvery-eyed,
golden-eyed, violet-eyed, amber-eyed, red-eyed.

> 
You feel a voice echoing in your mind...
       Think any of them and it becomes reality.
> think green-eyed
Your shape begins to change...now you look green-eyed.
The globe of eyes changes a bit...
> 
You sense a voice in your mind...
Now you have an "appearance", but it's far from perfect... This was 
your first wish, hopefully not the last. You can think about other
traits as well, just examine the other globes too... Also take my
advice... The first two traits you choose will be your main traits
unless you want it otherwise...things which can be seen obviously by anyone
who meets you... The rest will be not so obvious but will be seen if
someone takes closer look on you.
> l mirrir
You don't notice that here.
> l mirror
You look at the mirror.
Looking at the mirror you see:
Green-eyed dryad

> l globes
You look at the globes.
As you look at the globes more carefully you see a few of them a bit closer to
you. You can see a globe of eyes, a globe of skins, a globe of noses, a globe
of ears, a globe of hairs, a globe of physique and a globe of faces.
> l globe of ears
As you look at the globe of ears closer you sense the following traits you
could inherit...
You think your ear could take a shape of: big-eared, small-eared, jug-eared,
elongated-eared, large-eared, flapping-eared, huge-eared, one-eared,
pointy-eared.

> think pointy-eared
Your shape begins to change...now you look pointy-eared.
The globe of ears disappears with a loud *POP*.
> 
You sense a voice in your mind...
You definitely look somehow now but still not perfect... Now you have two
main traits, think of your other traits and change your shape. Don't forget
that you can change your main traits any time only you have to want it. One
more advice you may take... If you don't like your appearance think to void
and you will lose your shape...
> l globes
You look at the globes.
As you look at the globes more carefully you see a few of them a bit closer to
you. You can see a globe of eyes, a globe of skins, a globe of noses, a globe
of hairs, a globe of physique and a globe of faces.
> l globe of skins
As you look at the globe of skins closer you sense the following traits you
could inherit...
You think your skin could take a texture of: spotted, freckled, tattooed.

Ethereal plane. 
You are in an endless hall which stretches in all directions. There are no
walls at all only the ground is solid... When you look up (or is it down?) only
a low dim light can be seen... There are dozens of crystal globes floating all
around in various sizes and colours. Most of them are beyond your reach because
moving here is limited for you somehow. You also notice a strange shimmering
mirror close to you... It is dimly lit here.

File revision: Tue Oct 22 20:38:38 2013
You don't have a background. See <help background>.
> help background
--=== Help for background (Syntax help) ===--
Info: Backgrounds are a set of initial parameters your character starts with. 
It consists of a childhood biography (the history of the start of adventuring
career), the initial inventory of the character, the aptitude bonuses for the
skill groups and the starting place of the adventurer.

When you want to choose a background you have two options.  Either you choose
from the ten random backgrounds which have been picked for your character,
these backgrounds are completely fitting your character's race, gender and
sometimes even traits will affect them.  Probably you will find a short story,
about why you became broken tailed, or a story only available to tall, blue
eyed people.

If you want to write your own background, you must follow the rainbow line in
the matrix room (at the end of the character generation).  In this room you can
write background and set skill bonuses.  Your background must completely fit
the theme of the mud.  Not even a little typo is allowed, it is better if you
start playing after you have a complete image of your would-be character. 
Distribute the starting aptitude bonuses according to the background.  For
example an aspiring shaman or priest should have a higher faith background.  Or
a person born and raised in a forest should have a higher nature aptitude.  You
can also have some starting equipment which you have full control over.  Don't
expect superb gear though, this stuff must also fit in with your story,
especially if it is a less common item.  Like your family heirloom, a noble
longsword.  In these cases we expect a full and complete story.  After you have
finished with all details you must try to follow the line again.  This will
enlist you as a character awaiting approval.  

About a day later you might expect some other message than your background is
still unapproved.  If it is just some typos you see in the message, don't
change your stuff fundamentally.  Just look at the text again and correct it. 
If it needs more work on, then write a longer story.  If you have to rework it
completely then the wizards were not satisfied with your story.  In this case
you must write a new story, or just chose a pre-defined background.

If you already left the matrix room without a background, you can go back 
by entering the pillar in the Square of Hope.
