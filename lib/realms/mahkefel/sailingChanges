made ships not give death xp if captain was 25 levels lower than you. (Will still give xp on crit, mostly due to oh god that's way more typing.)

made ships give more money, specifically adding prize bonus to size to calculate the value, not just size. Will effectively double money I think, more or less. (as is prize bonus does very little).

I'm going to make it easier to escape sea combat--currently this shit is impossible, so if you ever take a gun crit oh hai you lose a ship, and like > 1 million imperial, which you do not goddamned make back sailing.
