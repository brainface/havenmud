12/04 15:26:08 [022] Kalinash@Crat's Agony [intercre] i'm surprised my baby knows how to play with her plastic rotary phone
12/04 18:52:55 [023] Wodan@Discworld [intercre] casting in lpc is different if you don't cast it will try to convert, if you
do cast you tell the driver it's already that type
12/04 18:54:11 [024] Wodan@Discworld [intercre] also them rotating phone dials were fun, and slow
12/04 19:00:10 [025] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] The weird thing in LPC is that the type sticks to the value, not the
variable.
12/04 19:00:34 [026] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] In "normal" languages, if you declare int x; x is always an integer.
12/04 19:01:22 [027] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] But in LPC, if you declare int x; and then x = (int)3.0; x will be a
float.
12/04 19:03:19 [028] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] eval int x; x = 3.2; return x;
12/04 19:03:24 [029] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] eval int x; x = (int)3.2; return x;
12/04 19:04:55 [030] Wodan@Discworld [intercre] yes, because you told it it will be an int, it doesn't check and just copies
the whole value, type and all :)
12/04 19:05:42 [031] Wodan@Discworld [intercre] i do hate that in lpc, should really only work for mixed
12/04 19:05:57 [032] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] It makes sense, but it's exactly the opposite of what people with
programming experience expect. :)
12/04 19:06:44 [033] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] If you come from C, you'd expect the first one to error, and the second
one to convert 3.2 to an int.
12/04 19:07:07 [034] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] If you come from Perl, you'd expect them BOTH to end up giving you
integers.
12/04 19:07:21 [035] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] (implicit vs. explicit conversion)
12/04 19:08:08 [036] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] LPC is effectively forcing the square float peg into the round integer
hole... and no lube.
12/04 19:08:38 [037] Wodan@Discworld [intercre] and it fits!
12/04 19:10:08 [038] Quixadhal@Bloodlines [intercre] Yep, and it even feels good for a while, but be careful sitting down
for a bit afterwards.
