Duuk {meta} Want me to melt your brain?
Sapling lurches towards you.
Duuk {meta} Because to understand direct and indirect, you need to forget everything you learned about english grammer
Duuk {meta} because it's wrong
Duuk {meta} when you need to utilize two objects in 1 verb, you have to use direct and indirect
Sapling digs into the ground with its roots.
Duuk {meta} direct is the 1st object in the command, indirect is the 2nd
Sapling digs into the ground with its roots.
Duuk {meta} so if I have a sword and I want to give the sword to Bob
Sapling digs into the ground with its roots.
Duuk {meta} direct_give_obj_to_liv would be give sword to bob
Sapling lurches towards you.
Duuk {meta} So
Sapling creaks ominously.
Duuk {meta} direct_give_obj_to_liv() would get called in the sword ("can the sword be given to bob?")
Sapling creaks ominously.
Duuk {meta} and indirect_give_obj_to_liv() would get called in bob ("Can bob be given a sword?"
Sapling lurches towards you.
Duuk {meta} m where it gets fun is if the verb can be used in different syntax
Duuk {meta} like "give bob sword"
Duuk {meta} now direct_give_liv_obj() is called in bob (can bob be given the sword)
Duuk {meta} and indirect_give_liv_obj() in the sword (can the sword be given to bob)
Sapling lurches towards you.
Duuk {meta} even though, grammatically, bob is always the indirect object and the sword is the direct object
Duuk {meta} Your petty grammar rules mean nothing here!
