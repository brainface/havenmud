TECH ORDER :

pottery, horseback riding, writing, stonemasonry, iron working, archery, calender & trapping if needed else roads 
then focus on getting the wonders : hanging garden, orcale, then engineering, then public schools
then get workshops/market land improvements and straight on to the porcelin tower.
(keep in mind to update naval & land military power as well as researching cargo ships/water luxuries as applicable)
if you have sea luxuries, wait until you you have triremes to defend vs. barbarians

BUILD ORDER :

Monument, Scout, Shrine, Granary, library (or wonder then library). build stoneworks/water wheels asap. also dont
forget your great person guilds (art, music, writing & the national epic).  NEVER FOUND 4th (or 5th depending) CITY 
WITHOUT BUILDING NATIONAL COLLEGE IN CAPITAL! the national college is key to out teching and thus out playing everyone.

POLICY ORDER :

tradition opener, liberty to free worker, then to free settler, then finish all of liberty. then finish all tradition.
from here you should be able to delve right into rationalism. get the policy for +2 sci/ specialist in cities and then
the bonus for research agreements or delve into aesthetics depending on strategy.

always settle first city in start position
use warrior to scout circularly around capital city until scout. return warrior to city. continue to scout with scout.

LAND IMPROVEMENT ORDER :

horses (food/production), 1-2 luxury (happy/gold), stone & marble (wonder production boosts), all foods, all luxuries

FUTURE CITY BUILD ORDER :

shrine/monument, granary, library, workshop : focus on food first, then production then science with mindfulness
to happy points/faith/military when needed.  try to supply new cities with existing military and purchase or build
new units where it doesnt take more than 7 turns.

MILITARY CONSUL :

save all initial monies to buy archer in capital.
defend worker/improvements with warrior/city/archer.
initial improvements should be no further than 2 tiles from city for defense (unless no other choice ie: iron/happy/gold)
trade horses for iron to AI at 1:1 ratio if needed.
bribe aggro AI to war with others, or others to war with it.
Don't flex too much military unless needed or you have muskets/trebuchet

LAND IMPROVEMENT & GREAT SCIENTIST CONSUL :

farms on every grassland. chop forests when building wonders. markets on all plains
and in all jungles. mines on all hills. place great scientist improvements on any flat
surface that is not a grassland by a river (more food). use /all/ great scientists to
build academies /until/ you have research labs, then use for tech gains. do not destory
mines for academies, if needed, send to second best science city.

TRADE CONSUL :

have atleast 1 trade route in the early game. try to maintain half of max routes until max routes is plausable (barbarians).
spread trade out. no more than 1 trade route per civ. use city states. 
only after this add additional trade routes/civ. if faith, spread faith to city states/civs via trade.

IDEALOGY :

only take autocracy if you are sure of a quick and decisive military win against the entire world.
take order if number of cities (or projected number of cities) is greater than 4 else take freedom.

CULTURAL CONSUL :

do not neglect great people. build writers guild & national epic early.
great works of art only say they produce +2 tourism. when placed in a city, that city
also gains +2 culture/turn per great work! build cultural buildinds. you want to maintain
a new social policy once/10-20 turns.

FAITH CONSUL :

  mostly worthless.

  with that said, faith points can be spent on great people once you hit the industrial age.
  the great people you can buy via faith depends on the social policy trees you have unlocked.

  with tradition/aesthetics/rationlism all maxed out & owning the holy city of a faith, you can select :
  (liberty gets a free great person when you finish it out, and thus grants no special great person faith purchases)

    Great Prophet
    Great Engineer
    Great Scientist
    Great Artist
    Great Writer
    Great Musician

the cost starts usually around 670 faith, and goes up each purchase.
with this is mind, even if you dont /found/ a faith, or you don't even want one, it is smart to build 
shrines/temples/pagodas/cathedrals/mosques/etc when the costs are low or the faith is accumulated.

WONDER CONSUL :

  The Only Wonders That Matter :
  
    the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus ~ if you have 2+ stone/marble in cap, build this 
      (stone/marble for boost in gold)
    the Pyramids ~ if you take liberty, build this. worker speed is win.
      (Liberty only : 2 free workers + 25% worker improvemenmt speed)
    the Oracle ~ always good
      (free social policy)
    the Hanging Gardens ~ if you take tradition, build this. food is win.
      (Tradition only : +6 food/turn in city it was built)
    the Porcelin Tower ~ science. if you have many allies, build this. science is win.
      (+50% science gains at completion of research agreements)
    the Hubble Space Telescope ~ science
      (+2 Great Scientists && +50% production towards spaceship parts)
    the Neuschwanstein ~ OMFG AWESOME (if you can get it)
      (mountain within 2 tiles of city, +3 gold, +2 culture, +1 happy for every castle in every city)
    the Cristo Redentor ~ policies
      (Future policies cost 10% less)
    the Great Firewall ~ protect technological success
      (99.9% spy effectives in city built, all other civ's spies get -25% effectiveness)
    the Leaning Tower of Pisa 
      (+25% Great People generation &&  1 free great person)
    the Petra ~ if cap city is desert tiles, you MUST build this. works well with morocco.
      (+1 food/production in this city's desert tiles, +6 culture/turn, free caravan)
  

VICTORY CONSUL :

no matter what victory, science is your key. food is key to science. 
happiness is key to population growth. culture enhances everything. GOLD!
