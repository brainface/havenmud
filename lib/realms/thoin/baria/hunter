  Hunters are a type of warrior whose skills revolve around hunting
  for food and defending villages. Available only to very primitive
  races and tribes, they make for an excellently balanced class for
  players that want rounded skills. Hunters have many skills useful
  for maintaining the tribe and village, such as repair skills and
  all the skills necessary for hunting for food in a dangerous
  environment.
