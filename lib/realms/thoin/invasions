Here are a few invasion ideas:

    Goden Viking Raiders who can attack Tairi, Goruv and Parva.

    Samurai War Party who can attack Gurov and Keryth

    Dwarven War Party who can attack Karak Varn, Argoth, or Kresh. The dwarves can be either from Glimmerdin or Vale Castle.

    Demon Invasion of Jidoor just because there is a vortex is there.

    Demon Invasion of Durgoroth just because there is a portal there

    Dwarf clan vs. Dwarf clan. Glimmerdin Dwarves war against the Vale Castle dwarves and vice versa.

    Daemon attack on Grymxoria and Nosferatu invasion on Durgoroth.

    Ice Giants and Ogres invade Keryth

    Desert Nomad invasion on Yozarth
Fire Giant invasion of Yozarth

    Yozarth Faithful call a jihad against all the unfaithful of Kailie

    Dark elf pirate invasion of all towns with harbors with a few evokers in the war party
