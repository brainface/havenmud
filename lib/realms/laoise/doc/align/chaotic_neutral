Chaotic neutral characters believe that there is no order to anything,
including their own actions. With this as a guilding principle, they tend
to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are
irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are extremely
difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to cheerfully and
for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they have on the roll of
a single die. They are almost totally unreliable. In fact, the only reliable thing about
them is that they cannot be relied upon! This alignment is perhaps the most
difficult to play. Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.
