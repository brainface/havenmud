These characters are the bane of all that is good and organized.
Chaotic evil characters are motivated by the desire for personal gain and
pleasure. They see absolutely nothing wrong with taking whatever they
want by whatever means possible. Laws and governments are the tools of
weaklings unable to fend for themsevles. The strong have the right to take what
they want, and the weak are there to be exploited. When chaotic evil characters
band together, they are not motivated by a desire to cooperate, but rather to
oppose powerful enemies. Such a group can be held together only by a strong
leader capable of bullying his underllings into obedience. Since leadership is
based on raw power, a leader is likely to be replaced at the first sign of weakness
by anyone who can take his position away from him by any method. Bloodthirsty
buccaneers and monsters of low Intelligence are fine examples of chaotic evil
personalities.
