Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with themselves
and their own advancement. They have no particular objection
to working with others or, for that matter, going it on their own.
Their only interest is in getting ahead. If there is a quick and easy
way to gain a profit, whether it be legal, questionable, or obviously
illegal, they take advantage of it. Although neutral evil characters
do not have the every-man-for-himself attitude of chaotic characters,
they have no qualms about betraying their friends and companions
for personal gain. They typically base their allegiance on power and
money, which makes them quite receptive to bribes. An unscrupulous
mercenary, a common thief, and a double-crossing informer who
betrays people to the authorities to protect and advance himself
are all examples of neutral evil characters.
