  Necromancers are dark and hidden mages that practice the dread magic
  of necromancy.  Their spells involve creating undead creatures and
  the horrors of servitude beyond life.  

  The Necromancer is a powerful mage, but is avoided by people of 
  respect and order in the world.  This class is one that is feared and
  loathed by the majority of the world.
