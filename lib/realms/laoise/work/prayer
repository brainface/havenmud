12/03/2005 12:49:40 -- Saahagoth {prayer} Doratherlin: Dark Mistress, I have never asked for anything from you since you brought me into the fold of the Saahagoth Church, all I have done is loyally served, no questions asked.  I have murdered all the enemies who would so boldly step into Durgoroth(my town), I have faced unthinkable odds and have walked away triumphant, I have kept the town which worships you and I am not even a legal citizen safe from the hands of Kylin justice.  I am but a frail lamrani, such glorious burdens have all but destroyed what the shadowguards left me with when they tossed me from Jidoor.  Soon I fear I will expire, common colds are enough to make me bed-ridden, my glory days are all but over, I want to ascend past this lamrani shell is what I am asking, I want to be accepted in the town which I so bitterly bleed and die for, mold me in the likeness of something which presides in Durgoroth of beg of you.
