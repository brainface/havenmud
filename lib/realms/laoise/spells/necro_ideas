cauterize wound - use heat to stop bleeding. Should take away some hp 
	from damage of using heat
clone - create a clone of a target. Maybe make it like vampyres from haven
	undead invasion - you cast it on a dead body and it jumps up as
	a vampyre of itself/familiar (esp fun with PC targets)
control undead - charm for undead targets
creeping doom - mob of snakes (?like vermin horde)
detect undead - locate undead in nearby rooms (?Zedd have a failure 
	that did nearby effects?)
ennervate - drain strength. Maybe like an anti-planar strength?
feign death - have the person mimic themselves undead? or mimic an npc 
	undead?
hold undead - paralysis spell that works just on undead
hypnosis - lull target so they're succeptable to vampiric touch. Not 
	paralysis, just prop.
magical jar - like create magic reserve, but is a jar of stored hp.
	(might be too abusable)
summon shadow - basically summon familiar
vampiric touch - sucks hp from the target. If not hypnotized, works like a
	combat spell. If hypnotized, get a chance of reacting or letting it 
	happen.
uncontrollable fear - like the laughter spell, but everything causes the 
	target to run in fear
