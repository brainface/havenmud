* = ones that may have "not codable" problems

grease - trap spell that creates a greasy substance on the ground
    which will -> POSITION_LYING & chance of stunning or paralysis
    or damage
taunt - (could also be illusion) - old fashioned DnD taunt spell
    where you have a chance to enrage the target in to attacking
    you, but they'd have to saving throw vs combat penalties due
    to their enraged state (maybe also doesn't work with rage-y
    races like orcs, who are used to it)
uncontrollable laughter (or illusion) - like the nightmare visions 
    one, but make the person just keep laughing hysterically. No 
    running around, but could possibly consider paralysis. Although 
    that'd depend on spell level
wall of fire - wall object that would block the exit specified by
    the caster

--------------------------------------

weird - Dnd spell, where you create an image of a "feared creature"
    (see shadow killer stuff above), but in this case they have
    "illusionary combat" with the target, then go poof. So basically
    you'd see Kysanth appear, attack you for a bit, then disappear.
    Could make it real combat but weak/fake kysanth.
