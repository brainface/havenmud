aura of peace - effect like sanctify, but moves with caster
calm chaos - opposite of incite violence (would stop any
    combat in the effect area)
    - wouldn't have the other effects like sanctify, would be
    more like the immortal <halt> command
earthen grasp - hands come up from ground and hold target
    - can see it as a paralysis spell OR as a trap spell 
    (object in room that's targeted by someone walking in)
*fire burst - caster points at existing flame (e.g. torch) and causes
    it to flash & shoot fire arrows
fist of stone - gives target hands of stone to use as weapons for 
    duration of effect
fool's speech - caster and target both learn language for duration
    of spell that only they understand (?random language name generator
    or temporary wedding ring type object that gives channel)
    channel object is probably easier code, but "fake language" that
    other people can see you're speaking is better rp
great circle (black circle) - area affect which harms any undead OR
    harms any evil aligned that enter the area (opposite which harms
    any good, especially paladins)
invisibility purge - area effect which renders all invisible visible
    - higher level version that sets up a "field" effect
know language(s) - possible effects during spell duration
    - learn primary language of spell target (e.g. pc, npc)
    - learn all of target's languages
    - have ability to understand all languages
*miscast magic - causes next spell target casts to be drawn randomly
    from their spell book (so could be a spell they have a nasty
    failure on due to not knowning it well)
protection from paralysis - nfc how to do this, but maybe an
    invis object or shield that protects? Problem would be having 
    to add a check in to paralysis spells/effects to check for this
rot - would make food rot/disappear, make spell-created food poof faster
sacred guardian - sets property on target which tells caster when
    they are in danger. Could have it notify caster when:
    - target enters combat (e.g. for protecting city npcs)
    - when target gets low on hp (so you can distance heal them etc)
shreaking walls - room effect spell where anyone that walks in to
    room hears shreaking voices
    - DnD version gives affected people "1 turn" of chance to leave,
    and then effects hit. Paralysis/stunning (?set them dazed)
tenticle walls - could be a wall spell where the wall object also
    grabs/paralyizes people
undead ward - wall or object that prevents undead from passing or leaving
watery double - draws from body of water (cup, well, ocean) to make
    a watery double. Size depends on size of body of water used to
    cast it on
zone of sweet air
    - dispel poison clouds
    - ?healing pillar that cures poison

* = would fit in chaos magic
** Check std spell objects - Saw some wall objects in there that
   don't have associated spells right now

Can we come up with something to protect from weather hot/cold
damage? It's not actually done through damage_type, but through
body, so might not be possible

More theoretical (not sure the code will support them):
chaos combat - DnD version is get a boost for 2/3 of your attacks
    other 1/3 you have a chance of bad effects
    - maybe make a spell that boosts str/dur but decreases luck?
    have to look in to how those effect combat
    OR have it boost combat skills but decrease luck
defensive harmony - boost to defense skills
fire purge - protect area from any fire
thief's lament - suffer penalty to thief skills
