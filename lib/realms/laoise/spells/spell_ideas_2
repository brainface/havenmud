charge staff/charge object - allows a high level cleric or mage
    to imbue a staff (mage) or holy object (cleric) with a spell
    that

    OR drop it. Maybe some chance of "blowing up" the weapon in
    question
transmute metal - change metal to another material (?wood)
    - could in theory use to let mages get good armor then
    make it material -> wood, so they'd be able to use it
