Composite List of Kresh "Stumblings"

- No Mayor
    Thus, no estates (not sure if this clashes with 
    the whole 'nomadic' theme of the town.) If mayor 
    implemented we would need to map out how many 
    estates per room etc.

- No Controller
    Kresh has no local quests

- Sap OBJ calls for SetClass("Valkyr") a class which 
  hasnt existed in some time. Could change this to 
  rogue for the Goblins or leave alone and keep 
  linking to a broken class.  
  
- Upon class joining all classes should be given 
  their starting weapon. Would have made my newbie 
  shaman run easier. Would make this newbie town 
  easier.
  
- Horde tent. News board links to nothingness. Also 
  would be good place to put player news board since 
  none exist here. (for the town board) Kresh has 
  a haven announcements board/ooc Discussion.
  
  
BUILDER NOTES

  - Found a weird pathing to the leather store in 
    the town. Fixed it with the town defs - "goblin.h"
    
  - No clue who "Kharn the Destroyer" is. Referenced 
    in Shaman tent. Items that belonged to him. No 
    further descriptions.
