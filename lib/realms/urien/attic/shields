Forced Shields upon NPC spawning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 NPCs can be wizards and even powerful mages if you 
  so desire. Here is something to get them a little 
  edge against the playing field. This will fire up 
  as soon as the NPC is loaded. Put this at the end 
  of the file, after the ::create

void heart_beat() {
  ::heart_beat();
  if (sizeof(GetMagicProtectionNames()) < 3) {
      eventForce("cast wall of force");
 }
}
