Summary
~~~~~~~

 This is an approach to add more flavor to the world
environment. Region assumed/specific spawn locations.
NPCs will vary from merchants selling 'random' wares 
to shifty goden traveller. This will extend to 
everywhere. A giant pool of NPCs. 

ROOMS
~~~~~
 
 None!!

NPC
~~~

 Intended to be less than 50 unless a specific NPC
is worth noting, like a travelling scholar or a 
food vendor. A stray citizen actually leaving the 
town, all NPCs will be docile. Level 100+ questers 
(which is what the highbies can kill) will be 
named and generated like a unique NPC. Every NPC 
generated for this will be clothed or wearing 
something/killed for value. Alignments will make 
sense on what you kill. 

NOTE: Quest givers will most likely be an errand 
      that only involves delivery, level range 
      from 1 - 250.


OBJ
~~~

 Little to none. This is going to be used to also
sneak things on NPC's for crafting/install in the 
game. Variant things to farm. Literature. Food,
whatever you wish.

Treasure
~~~~~~~~

 Little money on sentient beings. Animals are always 
pelted. At most would be sensible armor. Textile to
Leather for most of the NPCs. Very rare mithril. 
Sensible chain -> plate armor classes as they 
will be on only good warriors.

Creator Notes OOC
~~~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~

 Noticed the southern coast area has some travellers 
and such that populate the main road. Keeping the 
journey linear but still adding diversity to the 
world. Adding more such as "a fluttering sprite" or 
"stray chicken" will put a good push on a wide 
variety of level ranges.
