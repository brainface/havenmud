//Still having issues with the armoury. Eating things....
//REMAKE the room and test issues with it from scratch
//and see if that absolves the issue.
//---DONE--- Ended up being a deep-inventory driver 
//issue. Literally too many items in the room.
//Less items fixed it.

You can read the scroll from the:
/realms/urien/ruins/npc/ghostwiz.c inventory 
without having it in your possession. We would 
need to make it so it can be only be activated 
if you have it on your body, not as it currently 
stands.

TC revealed no damage to the body on read.
It is commented out but still gives a 'you got 
hurt' message, which in reality didnt happen.
You just ported. And nothing else. Why you lyin?

Need to Go through one more time and pre QC 
before submission, and design how the WESTWOOD 
will tie into the area through DEFS not hardcoded 
into the files. I believe i kept this to 
lock in 'where the area was' in relation to the 
virtual.

Need to test the fishing of the albino fish 
and make sure its not an Overpowered/practical 
reward for fishers

I do not make the drawbridge up/down during 
the daylight/night obvious. I think i did 
but need to run through area and look at the 
'paintings' in more detail or add it to the 
book hidden in the wall.
