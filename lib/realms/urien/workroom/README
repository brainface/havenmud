Stuff in here is for my workroom, all the files here connect 
to something, so moving or editing them will cause things 
to break. None of this stuff is aimed to be in game nor do I 
intend it to be. I dont mind if you view the files, Immortal 
knowledge belongs to the world.

To keep my homedir clean, I defined the exits locally which 
is not exactly recommended when making an area. This is for 
fun so I don't think anyone will mind since its personal.

Kinda did this to get back in touch with the Haven system
as TMI-2/MUDOS is slightly different. Again, feel free to 
look around!
