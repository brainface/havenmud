Backpacks - dest inventory on logout, cannot be worn (changed all LIB_WORN_STORAGE to LIB_STORAGE because crashes?)

Estates - set longs don't work (I don't think the descriptions save), also they sometimes exit to strange places, (Also mike wants "bigger estates" more rooms, etc.
and "savable furniture")

(Mike also said "horses" and "shapechanging" but you can ignore him because he's too awesome and can use ed.)

I want to know if it's possible to make the game stop making me type FIRST everything and just assume it.

I also want to know if it's possible to make the mud let me do multiple things at or nearly at once.. such as "drink waters" and "look at knives" 

Player owned shops - mike says they're buggy and said the words "zaxan code" and not buggy buggy but maybe sometimes works perfect and maybe crashes the server
sometimes (he's harder to get real words out of than I am)

Custom clothes tailors/armours - possible??

There's more that wants asking about.. but this is probably plenty to ask about for now
