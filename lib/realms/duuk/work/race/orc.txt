
	Vile and disgusting, orcs have no regard for what they
	consider to be the silly concepts of manners and dignity.
	They are large creatures with green hairless skin and
	mangled teeth that often protrude from their mouths
	disrupting their speech. While they are not the most
	intelligent of races, they are very durable and lucky
	and exhibit a kind of animal cunning which makes them
	very dangerous warriors. The other races look upon the
	orcs with fear and avoid them as much as possible.
