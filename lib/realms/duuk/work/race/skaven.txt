
	The race of skaven are best thought of as rat people.
	They are bipedal, but have typical rat-like 
	characteristics such as: claws, paws, tail and snout.
	They are covered in a short fur that is most commonly
	brown in color, but a few rare ones have been seen
	with various other shades. They are lithe and agile
	with incredible coordination which makes them very
	good at the less respected professions such as rogue.
	Because they are also fairly smart and wise it is not
	unheard of to encounter a skaven who is gifted in
	the magical arts. They currently live with the dark
	elves of Malveillant and practice the faith of Soirin.
