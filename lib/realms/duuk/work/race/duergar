
	The duergar resemblance to dwarves is near
	total. The main difference comes from
	the attitude exhibited by the races. The duergar
	are extremely violent and devious, embracing the
	fundamental ideals of the Soirin religion. They
	are short and stocky creatures with massive
	tufts of hair covering their heads and faces.
