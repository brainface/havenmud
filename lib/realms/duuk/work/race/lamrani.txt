	Lamrani are tall and very slim creatures with pale 
	white skin. They tend to reach about six to seven 
	feet at maturity.  They are physically very fragile 
	and weak but they are, without question, the perfect 
	race of mages.  Rumour has it that their mental 
	capability has granted them the awesome of abilities, 
	the power to stop magical damage from harming them.
	Another key feature of Lamrani is that they do not 
	walk.  Instead, they float about six inches from the 
	ground, entirely by the power of their mind.
