
	The race of nosferatu are tall, pale and gaunt creatures.
	They are bald with pointed ears resembling those of a 
	bat. Their mouths house a pair of large fangs that are
	razor sharp and lead many races to confuse them with
	vampires. The nosferatu's penchant for the taste of
	blood is not from necessity, however; but a kind of 
	epicurean practice found in their culture. They are very 
	militaristic and often revel in acts of sadism. They 
	live in the town of Grymxoria in the Estergrym Mountains.
