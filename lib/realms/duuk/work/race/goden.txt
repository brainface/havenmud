
	Godens are a race of cat-like humanoids who have
	established their home in the far northwest of
	Kailie in the town of Keryth. They are quick
	and nimble, but not the smartest of species.
	They are animalistic and tend to act upon instict
	as opposed to logical deduction. Their bodies
	are covered in thick fur and their faces portray
	a very feline heritage with pointed, fur-covered
	ears and small mouths filled with sharp teeth.
