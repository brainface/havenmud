	Muezzins are one of the joyous races of the world. They
	are a small and furry race in a way resembling small,
	bipedal bears. While they appear to be cute and cudly,
	the muezzins are a surprisingly strong race and are not
	a group to be trifled with lightly. While they would much
	rather live their lives peacefully in their forest home of
	the WestWood they have been known to aggressively defend
	their homes and lives with a strength and knowledge of 
	warfare to rival strict military societies. They tend to
	follow the ways of Eclat in a devout and missionary
	approach, spreading flowers and love where ever they may
	travel.
