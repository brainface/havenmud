
	Daemons are the children of hatred and chaos. 
	Originating from the depths of the lower planes,
	they are constantly struggling with each other
	and all other sentient beings on Kailie for
	superiority. As a race, they resemble creatures
	torn from the nightmares of small children:
	they have huge bat-like wings upon their backs,
	heads topped with horns and tough skin the 
	color of dried blood.
