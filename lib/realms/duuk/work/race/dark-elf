
	Hailing from the town of Malveillant, dark-elves
	are a very vain and proud people. Without exception
	they follow the Soirin religion and they exemplify
	the tenants of that religion. Beautiful, greedy,
	proud, and vain, the dark-elves are a people
	of great complexity with a social structure that
	is based upon a monarchial system that falls
	prey to the devious nature of those within it.
