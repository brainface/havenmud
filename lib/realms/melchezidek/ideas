make the upper/lower planes have levels/layers
  -> They should be level scaling, so up/down increases the levels
  -> Have each level have different creatures/etc
  -> Make the access points/portals randomly spawn like fire plans in the desert
  -> Have a supreme being at the very top/bottom -- just an excuse to have an
     awesome NPC that whoops ass and maybe gives a title/quest
