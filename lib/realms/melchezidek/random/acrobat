Focus: Defensive Combat

Acrobats are typically agile and lithe individuals
with a knack for wriggling out of sticky situations.
They focus primarily on winning a fight through 
attrition rather than pure force. Adventurers who 
choose the path of the acrobat are difficult to pin 
down and are typically high energy individuals with 
an inclination for the theatrical.
