Pleasurable Worship: How To Please the Mistress of Seduction
  by High Priestess Tallia Vestilanti


The Adoration of Alessandra is one of simple actions. It is the love of yourself. It is the love of your appearance. It is the love of your senses. It is the love of being. She adores you and wants you to be happy in all that you do, that is why she has granted us such pleasures in life. For our pleasure and our happiness Our Mistress has permitted us a free range of actions, nothing shall displease Her so long as it brings you pleasure and happiness and in turn, brings Her pleasure and happiness.
It is the sensual side of Our Mistress that appeals to most of her adherents. For She is the symbol of ultimate satisfaction in every aspect of life but especially in the bed chambers. The faithful of Alessandra should not fear what others may consider taboo and inappropriate in terms of sexual activity, for She delights in creativity and exploration. It is, therefore; our responsibility to be ardent and imaginative in our approaches and practices in the bed chambers. Pleasure is Her goal, and for the faithful, it is the path of piety.
