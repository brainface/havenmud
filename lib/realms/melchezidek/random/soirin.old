  Soirin is one of the major faiths of Kailie.
  Presided over by Alessandra, the Princess of Darkness,
  Soirin is the belief in ultimate satisfaction of all
  emotions to the extreme of self-indulgence.  The Soirin
  follower is one consumed by his lusts, desires, personal
  greed, and avarice.

  Soirin followers believe in expressing their own whims
  and desires with no regard as to the needs or desires
  of others.  While not everyone who does this can be considered
  to be a devout Soirin believer, a prayer said at the proper
  time to the Dark Lady is one that can go a long way towards
  insuring that a deviant desire is fulfilled.  The Soirin
  followers are covetous of beauty, riches, sensual pleasures,
  and material gains.  For the Soirin, life is a vainglorious
  attempt to achieve the picture-perfect life, and woe to any
  that prevent the devout Soirin from reaching that goal.

  The Soirin follower often blends into society with little to
  suggest he might be a follower of an evil goddess.  But the
  friendly and affable merchant that displays his wealth in
  a large and extremely richly decorated mansion is one that
  likely has muttered more than one prayer to the Dark Lady,
  and the lady that stares into a mirror commenting on her
  own beauty while hoping daily that a wealthy prince finds
  her is one that is certain to be a follower of the Mistress
  of Pleasure.

  Patrons of Soirin are those of Lust, Seduction, Greed, Vengence,
  Desire, Merchants, Deception, and Vanity. Prayers should be
  addressed to Alessandra, sometimes called the Princess of 
  Darkness or the Mistress of Lust.
