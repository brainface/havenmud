/domains/frostmarches/towns/arcanith/rooms/ruins8 -> North of the park
------
   This room (and a few around it) make mention of a Green Tower and Rose/Quartz Cathedral that are not accessible
   from anywhere? Sounds like good places for people to grind some small quest areas. Maybe an elaborate ritual
   to open access to them? Or secret passages from other places in the ruins?

Why are there so many different races in Arcanith?
--------------
   Are they looking for magic? Do we need an archeologist or some Indiana Jones type dude handing out quests
   to discover the 'Secret of the Ruins' or something? (Could tie into the tower and cathedral)
   - Could also tie into the Treasure hunter quests? (which there's only one of, I think?)


Necro Leader - done
-----------
   My thoughts are a well maintained Mausoleum in the cemetary? Title 'Bonecaster' -> a slightly different take
   on necros, with a focus of preservation/honoring the dead? Kinda like the old Kuthar ancestor worship stuff?
