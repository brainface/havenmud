Compilation of Ferry Issues

Bug 712 - Slush
The ferry captain in Parva is not working correctly. When you give him a ticket he will sail in circles until he runs out of fuel. However, if you give him the ticket to return to Parva, he will do so within 100 leagues regardless of how long he has been at sea. Also, the tickets remain on his person and are not destroyed when they are handed to him. This might be causing some of the aforementioned weirdness
