verbs/room/hide.c

-> currently only uses Climate, hiders stealth skill and agility stat for consideration

-> should take into account what's worn? weight maybe?
-> ambientlight in the room at time of attempt (40 is base, so anything below 40 should be a bonus)
-> coord/luck stats probably
-> size should help too -- big fuckers will find it harder to hide
-> How would we calculate camoflage? or something so that some gear can help hiding while others hinder? weight of objects that are worn? ambient light being given off by anything in the inventory?
-> Can there be actual objects that help hiding/sneaking? Like the ninja gear?
