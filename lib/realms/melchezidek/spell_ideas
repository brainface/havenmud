ICE
---
-Ice Prison. Freezes the target in an ice prison that is an object (moves them to a room generated that is really really cold)
             and they're trapped until the duration of the spell ends.... might bug out if player logs out
-Death's Embrace - provides protection from heat damage? Is this still possible?
-Icicle - CL clone? Maybe target damage to external limbs, avoid head/torso?
