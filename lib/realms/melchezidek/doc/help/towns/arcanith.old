Name            : Arcanith

Historical Theme: Haunted Ruins of an older civilization.

Races           : Kobold

Religion        : Magildan

Game Notes      : The Ruins of Arcanith are home to a small tribe of Kobolds.
                  The tribe is very different from most kobold tribes due to
                  the influence of the spirits that haunt the ruins. Their
                  religion is a strange energy-cult that is seen as a sub-sect
                  of Magildan, and the kobolds have an intense fascination with
                  the spirits that haunt them.
