 description:
        The diablolic scream is an ancient technique
        known among the warrior class of daemons known
        as the Horrors. The scream has a few facets,
        but when executed by a powerful Horror it is
        rumored to have the ability to kill. Most
        commonly, however, the scream strikes fear
        into the heart of their target typically
        rendering them paralyzed.
