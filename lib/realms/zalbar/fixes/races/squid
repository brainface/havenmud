# Nightmare race configuration file
# To add a race, make one of these files where the race name equals
# the file name, and type <addrace race> or <addrace race 1>.  The
# 1 means the race is a player race.  This file has the following
# format:
# line 1: race name
# line 2: min sight value:max sight value
# line 3: language (case sensitive)
# line 4..n: damage type:resistance level
# line n+1..o: stat:average value:stat class
# line o+1..p: limb:parent limb:limb class:comma separated armour types
# line p+1..q: hand:number of fingers
# damage types come from /include/damage_types.h
# armour types come from /include/armour_types.h
# Note that you may in fact have no resistances, thus line 4 would be
# the first stat.
