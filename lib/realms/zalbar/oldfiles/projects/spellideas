Bug        : Here are a few spell ideas for natural magic:'
Thunderclap - a newbie spell to cause fear in target. enchantment spell.
Wind Rush - high level mortal spell - similiar to the conjuring spell - psychotelekinesis
Wall of Thorns - HM spell similiar to the faith spell carapace
The next two shield spells only can be used during combat and disipate after combat is done:
Wall of Clay - mortal level 
Wall of Stone - HM level

The next few spells need are similar to charge and blast spells:
Summon Storm - calls forth a storm so other spells can be cast. Legend spell.
Call Lightning - calls forth a lightning to strike target. 
Hail - pellets target with small ice balls
Call Blizzard - calls for freezing wind at target
The wall of clay, wall of stone and summon storm spells all have to be cast outside.

In the Desert, the follow spells should only be cast:
Summon Sand Storm - target is blinded and slowed down.
Quicksand - target is paralyzed

Eyes of the Wolf spell - can make the character able to see in Darkness with out light

Windblast spell - uses wind to act like a missile towards target.

Sword to Snake spell - change targets weapon into a snake. Snake maybe hostile to weapon owner.  Legend Spell.
