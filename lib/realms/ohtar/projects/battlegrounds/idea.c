The Gauntlet Challenge: (NPC: One-Eyed Gritt) {ask gritt for a challenge}



In the middle (random area) of the ICY LAGOON (DOMAIN: GUROV) is THE GAUNTLET. This facility is where the survivors of this grouling area have travelled to testing their strength. They have all come to lay their lives on the line to prove they are the strongest of all. They understand that in the gauntlet you will win or lose, live or die against multiple foes in a row, one at a time. In the end only 1 can survive. If you prove to be the last person standing amongst all that enter then you will claim the ulimate prize of the bloody heart.

***Fight 10 individuals in a row that start at lvl 200 and go up 10 lvls per person. Ending at lvl 300. Some magical. Some dirty fighters. Some straight soldiers. Some mixed classes. NOTHING WILL BE EASY!!!!

This area will go UP from the Lagoon and will consist of about 15 rooms before getting to the arena. In this area there will be all aggro challenges from many different types of creatures. None of the creatures will be magical. Strickly combat creatures. Although they will have high ability to dodge/parry as well as very very good resistances to magic.
