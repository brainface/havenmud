InternalDesc "This room is obviously the owner's sleeping quarters.  A small pallet is set in the corner, meticulously restuffed to be perfectly rectangular with a blanket tucked in completely around the edges.  The top of the pallet is so smooth that it seems almost like a calm lake in appearance.  Beside the pallet is a very short table with perfectly stacked sheets of prayers to the Lord of Balance.  Across the room is a wooden chest.  The floor has a simple rug upon it and there is a single candle on the free wall with a figurine of The Lord of Balance, serving as a mini-chapel of sorts for the owner's prayer time."
