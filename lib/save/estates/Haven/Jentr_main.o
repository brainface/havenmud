InternalDesc "This room is sparsely furnished.  What there is, however, is pristine in appearance as if the entire room was a shrine.  By the door there is a small engraved sign, \"Take boots off when entering please - no dirt on the floors!\" and next to it is a place to wipe off swords so that blood does not get on anything in the room.  Another sign across the room is engraved with \"Animals are unpredictable - they are heathens and not permitted here.  Even pets.\"  Everything in the room is meticulously placed - there isn't a speck of dust anywhere to be found.  The room exudes a tension, a formality rarely seen in a personal home.  It seems as if the owner of this meagre estate is unable to leave anything out of place.  There is not even a scrap of food left on the floor."
