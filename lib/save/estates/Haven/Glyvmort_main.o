InternalDesc "Everything in this house appears to be in shades of gray or black. The only colors come from candles set sparingly around the room. It seems well kept, and dust is not noticeable on any of the bookshelves or small tables adorning the room. A modest desk sits in one corner bearing a ledger, ink, quill, and parchment. Towards the back of the room a forbidding looking door can be seen."
