InternalDesc "The walls inside this small shack are made of a thick, sturdy oak wood. The entrance to this shack has been ripped off showing the remaining hinges of a door that was there. A wooden door which remains untouched is in the north wall with a sturdy lock underneath the copper knob. An impressive collection of wine and beer bottles rest in a cabinet below two painted pictures of crudely made galley ships. A single chair rests near the cabinet with a trash can full of used liquor bottles."
