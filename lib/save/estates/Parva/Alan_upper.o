InternalDesc "This room has a single window in the east wall which proudly displays the shrine on the beach covered in shells. On the floor is a giant bed with no frame, stuffed with feathers next to a chest. The chest is mostly used as a nightstand due to the alcohol rings along the top of it. In a simple frame hanging on the east wall is a miraculous painting of two human men in Gurovian guard apparel. The elderly man is embracing a teenager in his arms with his face ripped off the painting and a knife through the teenager's heart."
