InternalDesc "This small back room contains the most powerful and rare of artifacts of the Shaman craft.  Ones that must be hidden from prying eyes and protected from thieves.  There is a shelf with small vials, including one that is labeled 'HiNdS bLoOd' in a crude script, but the most domination feature is the large wooden chest that adds yet another later to the already tight security of this room."
