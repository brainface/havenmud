InternalDesc "Lining the walls of this hut are all sorts of odd magical and priestly implements.  There are jars of strange liquids and powders on shelves, and an entire wall dedicated to the shrunken heads of vanquished enemies.  The smoke comes from a small brazier in the middle of the hut, and the intoxicating aroma pulls at your senses and disorients them.  There is a flap in the back that appears to lead to another room, but by the runes surround the doorway, you know entry will be impossible without the right key."
