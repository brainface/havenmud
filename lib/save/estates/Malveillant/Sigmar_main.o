InternalDesc "The solid oak door seals shut behind you as your eyes clowly begin to adapt to the low light of the room. After a few seconds, you notice a small beam of ligh shining in from the window which lands on the floor high lighting a large crack in the flooring. You are able to see dust settling within the beam of light which compliments the stillness of the room. A table sits right behind the window with two chairs at each end and a few scattered sets of tarnished silverware. A benchs sits next to a fireplace, which contains a few burning embers, holding an array of knives ranging from fat and jagged to slender and polished. A somewhat smaller door is barely visible on the western wall of the house and is covered by countless cobwebs."
