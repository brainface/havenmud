The Nightmare IV LPC Library allows creators to set dynamic variables in
objects which do not get saved when the object saves.  The variables are
called properties.  A property is an attribute of an object which is
considered fleeting.  This document serves to list the properties
commonly used and their purpose.  It is by no means complete, as the
point of having properties is to allow creators to build their own on the
fly.

Note: All properties are 0 by default unless otherwise stated.

Property: no attack
Values: 1 to prevent attacks, 0 to allow them
Things cannot begin combat from inside a room with this property.

Property: no bump
Values: 1 to prevent bumping, 0 to allow it
If a room, then nothing can be bumped from this room.  If a living
thing, then it cannot be bumped.

Property: no steal
Values: 1 to prevent stealing, 0 to allow it
This prevents stealing inside a room with this property.

Property: no magic
Values: 1 to prevent magic, 0 to allow it
This prevents any magic from being used inside the room if set.
Also: no conjuring, no chaos magic, no natural magic, no faith,
      no enchantment, no evokation, no necromancy, no healing,
     no planar magic, no divination
These prevent spells of the appropriate type being cast.

Property: no paralyze
Values: 1 prevents paralysis from occurring in a room, 0 allows it
Stops any sort of thing which might cause paralysis from occurring in
a room.

Property: no teleport
Values: 1 if teleporting is prohibited, 0 if allowed
Prevents people from teleporting to or from the room.



Property: magic 
Sets the string value that tells a magic item from a normal one.
For example, SetProperty("magic", "This magical staff glows.");

Property: lockpicking tool
Values: any integer marking how well lockpicking is enhanced
When picking a lock, the value of this property is calculated for each
object and added to the overall chance to pick the lock.

Property: blessed
Value: any integer
  Sets an amount of blessing on an object which will
  affect the abilities of weapons or armour.

Property: history
Value: A string
  Sets the 'history' of special items which can be determined
  by diviners or bards.

Property: login
Value: a string representing a file name
Sets which room a player should login to at next login if they quit
from the room that has this property.  For example, if you have a
treasure room that is protected, and therefore you do not want people
logging into it, you can call:
	SetProperty("login", "/file/name/outside/this/room");
to have the players login to the room outside.
