It is an option for all creators to upload your code files to the mud 
via FTP. All you have to do is use an FTP client to connect to 
haven.havenmud.com 4999. Login with your normal username and password and 
the files will be automatically moved to your /realms/ directory. 

If you login anonymously, the files will be put in /ftp. Remember 
that if you log in anonymously, you can ONLY access /ftp.

It is also recommended that you use Active transfer as Passive causes 
the server to refuse the connection.

Suggested FTP Clients: FileZilla, WS_FTP
