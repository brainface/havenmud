   --  How to get an Area or Town into the game --

 1) Mail Duuktsaryth (or duly appointed other) saying that your
    area is ready for approval.  DO NOT CONNECT it to the game yet.
    Doing so is cause for immediate removal.

 2) Duuk will enter your area at his earliest convienance.  Do not
    be upset if this takes a few days.  After all, he's busy.

 3) Duuk will likely find things wrong with your area.  He keeps
    good notes and will mail you with a full listing of all things
    that are wrong with your area.  Fix each and every one.

 4) Remail Duuk with the news of the completetion.

 5) Repeat as neccessary.

 

 Pointers:

  SetItems() for any noun mentioned, even if mentioned in another
  item's description.

  ie:  'exa tree'  The tree has leaves.
       'exa leaf'  The leaves are covered with bugs.
       'exa bug'   Aww, what a cute bug.

  Have both singular and plural of the nouns available.

       'exa tree'  'exa trees'

 Do not use 'you'.

 Use passive, vivid descriptions, not boring or routine ones.

 Have unique, differant NPCs with whom the PCs can interact.

 Make sure all NPCs conform to policy.

 Make sure all treasure is balanced.
