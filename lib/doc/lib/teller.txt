This document details the different functions in the Haven
Library's Teller inheritable. This document is divided into
many sections. Each section explains a different type of 
function in the lib inheritable.

Note that functions makred with /* REQUIRED */ must be used in
all tellers.

The following is the header of the teller inheritable with what
it includes, inherits, and its definitions:

***************************************************************
#include <lib.h>

#include "/lib/include/teller.h"
 
inherit LIB_SENTIENT;
  
string BankName, LocalCurrency;
string *Currencies;

int eventBalance(object who);
     Whenever a player (object who) requests their balance from
  bank teller, this is the function that is executed. First,
  the person's account information for that bank is retrieved.
  Next, the player is told the name of the bank he/she is doing
  business with, the date the account was opened, and the default
  currency for the bank.
     If the player has money in the bank, then a printout is
  made of all that money in their respective currencies. It is
  then totaled up and the player is told what that total is in
  the bank's local currency.
     Finally, the player is told the timestamp of the last
  transaction made at the bank.

int eventDeposit(object who, string currency, int amount);
     All deposits made by a player (object who) into a bank go
  through this. The procedure is very simple. First, the amount
  (int amount) of the currency provided (string currency) is verified
  by making sure the player is actually carrying the amount of
  currency that he/she wants to deposit. If no currency is provided,
  then the teller assumes that the deposit is to be made with the
  bank's default currency.
     If all the checks are successful, the currency is removed from
  the player's pockets and placed into their bank account.
