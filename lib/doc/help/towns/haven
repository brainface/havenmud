Game Notes      : Haven Town is one of the oldest and most developed
                  towns in the entirety of Kailie. She is protected
                  by the zealous Kylin Templars who go through various
                  degrees of xenophobic administration. Because of 
                  the careful watch of the Templars Haven Town is
                  a very ordered community that typically aims to 
                  please the patron god of Order, Duuk. Brawling,
                  stealing, spitting on old ladies, and other
                  acts of skullduggery are frowned upon by the
                  guards and will typically be rewarded with a
                  swift death.
            
Game History    : Havenites have a reputation for being very
                  arrogant and disrespectful of outsiders. They have
                  been known to lead many crusades against those
                  the Church of Kylin has deemed heretical, most
                  notably against Jidoor and Malveillant.
