Game Notes      : Glimmerdin is the home of the dwarves
                  in the Crystal Reaches. The dwarves 
                  have tunneled deep into the mountain
                  to create their home and have made
                  a veritable fortress out of the rocky
                  foundation. The dwarves of Glimmerdin
                  are holy and devout warriors dedicated
                  to the Lord of Order, Duuk. Their temple
                  to their Lord is one of the focal points
                  of the city.      
            
Game History    : Glimmerdin has housed the Dwarven race
                  for many years and as such, the dwarves
                  are very protective of it. They aid
                  the Haven Templars in their Holy Crusades
                  against heretics and are known to be
                  extremely stubborn and steadfast.
