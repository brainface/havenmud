Game Notes      : Baria is a small stone age village set in the Barian
                  Jungle. The jungle is a moderate level area at the far 
                  southwest corner of the main continent. This city 
                  features excellent starting locations for newbies and 
                  is a well developed place for players interested in 
                  roleplaying in a stone-aged culture.
                  
Game History    : Baria has been a visiting place for players since it 
                  first opened. While not an overly popular starting town, 
                  it is a well travelled area and is not without prospects.
