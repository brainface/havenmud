Game Notes      : Durgoroth is a cold and barren ruin
                  of a once mighty fortress. Nestled
                  deep within the FrostMarches, the
                  ruins are home to the ferocious
                  Daemon race who ran the nosferatus
                  and humans out after the great
                  migration to Grymxoria. Pure chaos
                  and anarchy rule in Durgoroth which
                  is best summed up with the phrase, 
                  "Survival of the Fittest." Within the
                  confines of daemonic society one is
                  always a threat and as such random
                  violence and murder are commonplace.
