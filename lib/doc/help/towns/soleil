Game Notes      : Soleil is the city of love and happiness.
                  It is inhabited by the small furry creatures
                  known as Muezzins who devoutly follow the
                  Eclat religion. They live in harmony with
                  nature and are fierce protectors of their
                  forest and livelihood. While the city's
                  philosophy is one of love, they have been
                  known to be quite militant when it comes
                  to defending themselves and their city.
