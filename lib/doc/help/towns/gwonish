Game Notes      : Gwonish is a village in the Gwonish Swamp, southwest of
                  Lloryk. The village itself is a small place for the truly
                  violent aspects of the Kuthar religion.

Game History    : Added as a player city first in 2006, the lizardmen and
                  their continual war against the Shire has been a backstory
