Game Notes      : The Duchy of Averath is an island some leagues south of
                  the main continent. A ferry runs between Haven Town to
                  the north and the fishing encampment in Averath. The 
                  Duchy is populated by particularly isolationist humans, a 
                  small outcast dwarven city to the west is the only other 
                  settlement on the island. The politics of Kaille at large 
                  seem to have little bearing on its people, and instead 
                  they seem to keep to their own strange ways. Visiting 
                  tourists should take caution outside the cities, as things 
                  are not always what they seem in Averath.

Game History    : The Duchy of Averath is most known as a destination spot
                  for those new to sailing.
