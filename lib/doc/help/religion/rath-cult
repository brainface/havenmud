  The Cult of Rath Khan is a VERY minor faith of Kailie, practiced
  by almost no one.  Strictly speaking, the vast majority of the
  followers of the Cult have been dead for centuries.
  
  In an era long ago, before the split of Dark-Elves from the Elves,
  a minor elven noble named Rath settled a tower south of the Jidoor
  Valley.  Gathering followers among the lesser creatures of the 
  Gwonish shore, Rath took the title of "Khan" to show his domination
  of these tribal creatures.  Growing in power, Rath Khan chose to
  seek one further lofty goal:  He would challenge the gods and so rule
  the world.
  
  The Tale of Rath Khan is a tragic tale, and the Kylin Templars have
  stamped out much of the knowledge of that era.  Rumors of books written
  in that time bring the attention of the Grand Inquisitors of Kylin down
  with speed, and thus it is that the Rath Cult hates the followers of 
  Kylin with a passion reserved only for those whose undeath is endless.
  
  Those who follow Rath Khan believe that he ascended to Immortality, 
  rather than accepting that Rath Khan is an evil creature neither alive,
  immortal, nor dead.  The cold and raging evil that is Rath Khan serves
  as their Immortal, and through means unknown to many he bestows the
  ability to cast spells like normal clerics.
  
  Rath Cultists pray ONLY to Rath Khan, Master, Emperor of Kailie.
