  Kuthar is one of the minor religions of Kailie.
  The Kuthar religion is really less of a god-worship and instead
  an oral tradition of ancestor worship and history of "tribe" or
  "clan".  This faith is most common among primitive races and 
  those less in tune with the Immortals of Kailie.
  
  Kuthar is neither a good nor evil religion, neither orderly nor
  overly chaotic.  It merely exists as a means to honor the ancestors
  and keep the traditions of the tribe going from generation to 
  generation.  In some races, such as the lizardmen of Gwonish, this
  religion has a decidedly evil focus, leaning towards the destruction
  of the Shire (the halfling settlement northeast of the swamp). In
  others, such as the goblins of Kresh, this is more of a traditional
  way and less "evil".  
  
  Kuthar has no patron gods, but prayers are often directed to "spirits
  of my ancestors".
