  Damhair is one of the minor faiths of Kailie.
  
  Damhair is the name given to the religion of the Drowned God.
  Based in Parva, the Damhair (derogatively called the "Damp Hair")
  faith are firm believers in the God of the Sea. His nature is vindictive
  and generous at the same time, and the Damhair follower understands
  both sides of that nature.
  
  The faithful of this religion is a firm believer that the sea will 
  provide all that is needed to survive, from food to drink, so long
  as respect is observed.  Damhair followers have an unhealthy dislike
  of storms, believing them to be statements of displeasure by the 
  God.
  
  The Drowned God is also known as the Master of Storms.
