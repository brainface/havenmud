  The Thorian cult is one of the minor religions of Kailie.
  Presided over by the Master of Death and Decay, He Who
  Is Not Named, Thoin, the cult has a terrible reputation 
  as devout bringers of death.  Though the cult has access to 
  certain magicks that hasten death, it should not be confused 
  with a truly evil religion, and the Thorian clerics would be
  the first to admit it.
  
  The Thorian cult not only brings death and disease and decay,
  they understand that death brings about new life, and decay
  is the way that all things return their bodies to continue the
  circle of life.  Therefore, the Thorian does not seek to take
  life before its time, but does not avoid the taking of life
  should the need or timing arise.
  
  Thorian minor aspects include disease, decay, and death.
  Prayers should be addressed to Thoin, sometimes referred to as
  "Master of Death", or "He Who Is Not Named", or sometimes 
  "Decayed One".
