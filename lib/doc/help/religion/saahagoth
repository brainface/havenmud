  Saahagoth is a minor faith of Kailie. It is ruled by Taigis the
  Bringer of Chaos.  
  
  This faith is the primary motivation of the Daemons of Durgoroth.
  This religion focuses solely on destruction and chaos, seeking personal
  survival over anything else and focusing only on personal power to the
  detriment of the town, race, and even religion.  As such, it is very rare
  for there to be many powerful priests of Saahagoth as they tend to turn
  and feed on each other with a frequency that prevents any serious gains.
  
  Saahagoth is a religion founded on the Lower Planes, and as such is very
  difficult for normal mortals to comprehend.  Saahagoth followers are often
  seen as self-destructive, because anything that the follower survives 
  can be said to have made it stronger.  Saahagoth followers are totally
  untrustworthy and find themselves opposed to EVERY other religion in
  the world.  In fact, their religion is so far beyond the pale that many
  normally opposing religions (such as Kylin and Aberach) would unite to
  crush Saahagoth should their power rise.
  
  Patrons of Saahagoth are all demons of the lower planes, and very few
  of the followers bother to pray anyway.  Those that do would seek knowledge
  and power from greater demons and devils than themselves, such as from
  Taigis the Lord of Chaos.
