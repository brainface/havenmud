So you are a builder on SOmud, and know nothing of Unix.
--------------------------------------------------------

First of all, directories in Unix work much the same as
directories under Dos or folders in Windows. For  example  
the directory C:\doc\build in Dos\Windows would be /doc/build
in Unix. Note the change from a back slash\ to a forward
slash/, also note, no drive letter is given, as in Unix,  
directories stem from a directory called root, known as /.

Some basic commands.

pwd   Tells you what directory you are currently working in.

ls    Lists the contents of the current directory you are in.
      Note that sub directories are prefixed by /.

cd    Change directory. eg cd /doc/build would move you to 
      working in the directory /doc/build

man   Used to read manual pages. These are text files you 
      will find under /doc. eg, when in the directory 
      /doc/build use the ls command to see the contents, then
      the man command to read one of the files. eg man npc

help  Used to read the help pages found in the sub 
      directories of /doc/help much like the man command.

mkdir Make directory. eg mkdir /realms/ptech/tmp would make
      a directory called tmp in my directory /realms/ptech

rmdir Remove directory. eg rmdir /realms/ptech/tmp would 
      remove the above directory. You have to remove all 
      files and sub directories contained in the directory
      you want to remove FIRST.

rm    Remove file. eg rm /realms/ptech/bunker.c would remove 
      the bunker.c file from the /realms/ptech directory. 

ed    Launches the muds unix text editor 'ed'. (see below)

Once you have read the documents in /doc/build and have looked
at some sample code (see below), you will need to create some 
directories so you can start building your planet or test area.
You will need at least 1 directory for your area, and sub
directories of /room, /npc and /obj within it. See /std/area
to see where things go. This is where the code for the area East
of your workroom lives, so look at it for samples of rooms, npc
and objects. Also note the area.h file in /std/area  You will
need one of these of your own ;)


The Very Very Basic use of ed.
------------------------------
The first thing you need to know about ed, is that it has 2 
modes of opperation. An Input mode and a Command mode. When
in Input mode, you can write/paste code into ed. When in
Command mode, you can issue ed with obscure commands like w
for save!!
 To get from Input mode into Command mode, you need to type a
single period (full stop.) on a line on its own. This should
give you the prompt : letting you know that you are now in 
Command mode.

Some basic commands for ed. (remember to be in Command mode)

**Note**
Some commands have numbers with them. Theres numbers come before
the letter command. eg 6p would print line 6 on the screen.

d    Delete line(s). eg 4d would delete line 4

h    Displays the help file for ed. It has alot more commands
     than this document.

i    Insert text starting before this line. 

p    Print lines on the screen. eg 1,5p would print lines 1 to
     5 inclusive of the file you are editing. 1,$p will print
     the entire file on the screen.

n    Toggle line numbers on/off. Works much like the p command
     eg 1,$n would add line numbers to the entire file.

q    Quit ed. If you have altered the file you are working on,
     ed wont let you quit unless you have saved it.

Q    Just Quit. Allows you to quit without saving.

w    save/write file to disc.

W    As w but appends file instead.


Looking at code with ed
-----------------------
Change directory to where the file you want to look at is located.
Type ed filename.ext (file extentions are .h for area file, and .c
for object files). ed should give you some infomation on the file, 
and be in Command mode.
Type 1,$p and it will print the file on the screen. If you want
to Toggle the line number on, Type 1,$n

There we go. Easy. when you want to quit, just type Q and no
changes will be saved.

Writing code in ed
------------------
Change directory to where you want the file to go.
Type ed newfilename.ext (where the file extention is .h for area
files and .c for objects). ed should now be in Input mode. Write
/paste your code into the mud. Type a period (.) on a line on its
own to get into command mode, then w to save and q to quit.

There you go, your file is on the mud. If it is a room, and you 
want to check it out, use the 'goto' command. 
goto /realms/ptech/workroom would take you to my workroom for 
example.(note no file extention like .c is used)

------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many more Unix commands and ed commands which you will
learn as time goes on (aswell as shortcuts;)), but these should 
be enough to get you started building your first area.

Happy Terraforming
