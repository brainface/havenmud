For example purposes, Zaxan is the caster and Milquitoast is the
target of the spell. Also, pretend that you are Zaxan (me) so you get
the correct image from the messages. Many examples will be used from 
the chill touch and missile spells.

An example is provided below.

****************************************************************************
SetMessages(({ ({ "are", "$target_name $target_verb "
		         "unharmed by $agent_possessive_noun "
			 "missile." }),
	       ({ "", "$agent_possessive_noun missile "
		      "stings $target_name." }),
	       ({ "", "$agent_possessive_noun missile "
                      "slams $target_name." }) }));

Messages are one of the hardest things about spells to explain. The 
SetMessages() defines what is printed to the room after a cast. The first
message is ALWAYS when a spell is unsuccessful. The second message is
a little bit of success, the third is a lot of success, the fourth is
LOTS AND LOTS of success, etc.

What's difficult about messages is the fact that you have to use those
darn things with the $ in front of them. Now we are going to go over the
first message thoroughly with what everything means. This is because you
need to think of what the three different possibilities of the message
is that can be echoed into the room.

This is how the message will look like depending on who it's viewed by.
Viewed by Caster: Milquitoast is unharmed by your missile.
Viewed by Target: You are unharmed by Zaxan's missile.
Viewed by Others: Milquitoast is unharmed by Zaxan's missile.

The word "are" that is used before the actual message is the verb that
can be used in the message. You define the verb before the actual message
and then replace it by $ arguments so it will change depending on who
sees it. You can put more than one verb before the actual message if
you are going to have two or more different actions by either the
caster or target in the message. A good idea is to think of your message
and then pretend you are the target to think of your verb. For example, you
wouldn't want to use "is" as your verb because then that's what the target
would see (You is unharmed by Zaxan's missile.). So you would use the
target infinitive of the verb. This would come out to "are" (You are 
unharmed by Zaxan's missile). A common mistake made by people is using
the verbs for the actual spell object (the missile). Notice the second
message. The missile stings the target, but it's not using $target_verb.
This is because the target isn't stinging, the missile is. Therefore, the
missile always stings, no matter who views it. Therefore, you will not put
that in the verbs section and you will just type in the action of the
spell object. Below is a section explaining all of the different $
triggers used in spells. The verbs used below are "are", and "become".

This may seem very confusing, that's probably because it is if you've never
worked with it before. At first, it just takes some guessing and checking
to figure out the messages. It'll catch on after awhile. If you are having
troubles making your messages, just ask someone.
