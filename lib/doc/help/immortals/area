    How to get an area approved for building on Haven.
 
 
 1) Make a directory in your /realms directory with the name of
    the area you want.
 
 2) Make a file called 'design' in that directory.  It should list
    a basic view of what you intend to do with your area.  It should
    list a theme and a general intent.  A sample is below.
 
 3) Begin coding.  A Sage or Arch will look at the design and give
    some help or reccomendations.
