  BASIC COMMANDS

  (What the heck do I do now?)

  cd:  "change directory", sets your current working directory to
       whatever you specify, or to your realms directory if you 
       do not give any arguments with this command.

  ls:  "list", shows all the files in your 'current working directory'

  home:  Takes you to your workroom.  In order for this to work, you
         must have a working room object as /realms/<yourname>/workroom.c

  ed:  edit text into a filename.  This is how you code files and edit 
       them once they are finished.  Please read 'help immortal documents
       ed' to get a better idea.

  'update' : Check the new code for a file for errors.  This will show 
             'Ok' if successful, or will tell you that there are errors.

  'elog'   :  Show the errors for files you have created.

  'rlog'   :  Remove your current error log, allowing you to make more
              errors and find them easier.

  'mkdir'  :  Makes a new directory for you to store things in, like
              'mkdir areas'

  'more'   :  Show what is in a file.  'more workroom.c'
