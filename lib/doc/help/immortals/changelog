Altered the maximum stat level to 125 regardless of stat class. This means that, should a lamrani somehow get obscenely lucky and advance their charisma, it will not be artificially capped below "max player stat".
 
** Wed Mar  8 11:45:03 2006 by Duuk **/
Player titles that include $N (such as "Sir $N the Knight of Glimmerdin") can no longer be in the 2nd title position.  This will stop "Sir Bob the Knight and Lord Bob the Lord" from displaying as a title.
 
** Wed Mar  8 11:46:15 2006 by Duuk **/
the oocname command will now automagically capitalize the entry.
 
** Fri Mar 17 20:45:01 2006 by Duuk **/
Disabled the censor on OOC.
 
** Wed Mar 22 22:07:52 2006 by Duuk **/
Changed the skills command to display "skill point score."
 
** Wed Mar 22 22:08:18 2006 by Duuk **/
Changed body.c to (hopefully) eliminate the "lost my left arm but didn't lose my left hand" bug.  Again.
 
** Fri Apr  7 23:04:29 2006 by Duuk **/
eventDie now removes all magic protections.
