NATURAL WORKING
Type: Repair
Commands: repair

You can repair items made of more esoteric natural
substances, such as bone or chitin, or base substances
like stone or glass. Repairing armour or weapons also 
requires armour smithing or weapon smithing, 
respectively.

Many trainers teach natural working.
