MITHRIL WORKING
Type: Repair
Commands: repair

You can repair items made of the strange metal known as
mithril. Unlike with steel or other base metals, heavy
armours crafted from mithril do not interfere with 
spellcasting.

Repairing armour or weapons also requires armour smithing
or weapon smithing, respectively. 

Many trainers teach mithril working.
