PLATE ARMOUR
Type: Passive Combat
Commands: compare

You are skilled in defending yourself while wearing 
platemail armour. Your limbs protected by platemail take 
less damage from attacks and damaged platemail still 
provides some protection for you. You also accurately 
compare two pieces of platemail.

Platemail provides very strong protection against attacks, 
but is usually made of metal, and will interfere with 
conjuring or natural magic.
