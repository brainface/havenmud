You are skilled in riding various animals as well as driving horse-drawn carriages and similiar vehicles.
Properly trained riders are also much better at picking out promising mounts from merchants. 

Note: anyone can ride common animals without difficulty, but those wishing to ride into battle or 
drive caravans should invest in training.
