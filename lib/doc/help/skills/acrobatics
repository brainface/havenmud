You are a lithe acrobat, leaping out of and into the battle with graceful
speed, launching your quarterstaff and often yourself at your enemies.
Acrobats learn to build momentum with each attack before aiming a devastating
blow at an enemy.

Rumors of a coffee-addicted gelfling willing to train all comers have been heard.

Acrobatics allows the following verbs:
