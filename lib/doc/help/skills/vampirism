You have been raised from death into an unnatural, hungry state of 
undeath.  You can no longer eat or drink mortal food, sunlight 
tires you greatly, and you must gain sustenance from feeding upon 
the blood of the living.  Newly raised vampires are weak and 
pitiful things, but grow in power and bloody magic as they age.
