VAMPIRISM
Type: Special
Commands: spells, cast, chomp
See also: <help combat actions>, <spellhelp>,
 <player documents magic>

You have been raised from death into an unnatural, hungry state of
undeath. You can no longer eat or drink mortal food, sunlight
slowly burns you, and you must gain sustenance from feeding upon
the blood of the living.  Newly raised vampires are weak and
pitiful things, but grow in power and bloody magic as they age.

Note: possessing 1 rank of vampirism makes you a vampire--even 
the greatest powers of resurrection cannot undo your fate. You can
"cure" yourself by dropping the skill at a skill trainer, though 
this is not recommended.
