CONJURING
Type: Major Magical Sphere
Commands: spells, cast
See also: <spellhelp>, <help player documents magic>

You are a conjurer, a master of summoning magical energy without the aid of a diety. Evokation and necromancy spells provide great protection and devastating damage, while enchantment spells provide a wide array of divinations, attribute boosting spells, and teleportation magic.

Conjuring is one of the strongest and most versatile spheres of magic, but you cannot cast spells while wearing metal armor.
