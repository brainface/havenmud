CLOTH ARMOUR
Type: Passive Combat
Commands: compare

You are skilled in defending yourself while wearing 
normal clothing and magical robes. Your limbs protected 
by clothing take less damage from attacks and damaged 
clothing still provides some protection for you. You can 
also accurately compare two pieces of clothing.

Cloth armour provides the weakest protection from blows,
but can be worn beneath heavier armours.
