CHAIN ARMOUR
Type: Passive Combat
Commands: compare

You are skilled in defending yourself while wearing chain 
armour. Your limbs protected by chain armor take less 
damage from attacks and damaged chainmail still provides 
some protection for you. You also accurately compare two 
pieces of chain armour.

Chainmail provides moderate protection from attacks, but 
is usually made of metal, and will interfere with
conjuring or natural magic.
