Type: Combat Action
See also: <help combat actions>

You are a maddened warrior, conquering your foes with axe and fury
instead of arcana anad tactics. Seasoned berserkers can work themselves
into a frothing rage, increasing their brute strength and vitality.

The art of berserking is said to have originated with the battle-mad
daemons of Durgoroth.
