NATURAL ARMOUR
Type: Passive Combat
Commands: compare

You are skilled in defending yourself while wearing 
natural armour, such as bone greaves or a hide skin. 
Your limbs protected by natural armour take less damage 
from attacks and damaged natural armour still provides 
some protection for you. You also accurately compare 
two pieces of natural armour.

Natural armour provides a moderate amount of protection
and never interferes with spellcasting, but can be 
somewhat hard to find, as few merchants deal with such
esoteric materials.
