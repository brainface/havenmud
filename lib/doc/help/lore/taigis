  Taigis
  
  Taigis is an old... friend... of Duuktsaryth's.
  
  Creatures of ancient creation, they were a pair inseparable at their
  ascension into immortality.  However, Taigis was lost to the world of
  Kailie very early, and his evil became known for what it is:  Pure
  Chaos.  His touch is the source of Ultimate Evil on the world of Kailie,
  and his Mark is the cause of the GodsWar.
