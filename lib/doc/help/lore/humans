  HUMANS
  
  Humans are the fundamental neutral race of Kailie.  Created as a compromise
  at the end of the GodsWar, the humans are represented by no god, and have no
  core beliefs.  This doesn't mean they are incapable of religion, only that 
  each human chooses their beliefs, and none is assumed as a default for them.
  
  Humans settle anywhere they can find room to build, and have also taken up
  residence within cities of other races.  Many races view humanity's lack of
  a cohesive religious force to be some sort of flaw, and this has caused 
  results ranging from quiet disdain (among the High Elves) to sadness (among
  the muezzin).  Other races view this as a very competetive urge to engulf
  all of humanity under the rule of their religion, such as the dark-elves.
