 In the beginning, magic was without form and void.  Energy ran wild,
 harnessed by whichever beings were able to seize it.  This lead to 
 many extremely powerful creatures throwing magical assaults around
 with glee. 
 
 And then were the gods created.  With the creation of Order and Chaos,
 the universe began to shape itself around these ideals.  Chaos magic
 was stronger, but unwieldy, prone to random results which could not
 be controlled.  Order magic was less powerful, but more stable.  This
 system worked, and the first sentient creatures to use this were the
 elves.
 
 The elves were creatures of Order, and their magic reflected this. 
 Some of the elves, however, were touched by Taigis, the Embodiment
 of Chaos. This led to elves dabbling in chaos magic, which lead to
 the whispers of chaos into the world.  Some of the results of these
 whispers can be found in other lore.
 
 When the Lord of Order began to see the expansion of sentient races,
 the first lesser immortal created was Zaxan.  Created specifically
 to further bring Order to magic, this creature eventually succumbed
 to the touch of Chaos.  During the GodsWar, Zaxan was nearly destroyed,
 banished to a Lower Plane for over a century of pain and torment. 
 
 With the conclusion of the GodsWar, the Lord of Order shattered the 
 power of Magic, breaking it into smaller spheres of influence.  Each
 sphere of magic would have only one aspect, and most magic users could
 use one, sometimes two of the spheres.  This prevented all-powerful
 magic wielders from ever again finding chaos magic, and prevented 
 mortals from unwittingly introducing additional Chaos into the world.
