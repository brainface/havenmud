Welcome to spell casting 101.  This guide will help you train your magic
to so you do not kill yourself or a loved one.  Good Luck.


Lesson One:  Spheres of Magic
**************************************************************************
There are three major Spheres of Magic:
        Faith
        Natural Magic
        Conjuring

There are four minor Sphere of Magic that need a major Sphere:
        Enchantment
        Evokation
        Healing
        Illusion
        Necromancy

Most spells require a major and minor sphere. For instance, fireball is a 
Conjuring Evokation spell, while hellfire is a Faith Necromancy spell.

Major Spheres:
The Faith sphere uses the stat wisdom. Spells of this sphere are derived from 
your deity but must be taught to you by a priest or priestess of your religion.

The Natural Magic sphere uses the stat wisdom.  Spells of this sphere are 
derived from nature and must be taught to you by a worshipper of nature such as 
a druid or shaman.

Conjuration sphere uses the skill conjuring and the stat intelligence. Spells
of this sphere let you manipulate energy and must be taught to you from
a mage such as an enchanter, evoker, or necromancer.

Minor Spheres:
Enchantment spells create or change items or physically or mentally alter a 
subject.

Evokation spells call forth elemental attacks, shields to protect from damage, 
or magical creatures.

Healing spells cure injuries or ailments. Conjuring magic cannot heal.

Necromany spells are unholy or dark magic, many of which deal with animating
or manipulating the dead.

Illusion spells create false images, sounds, or directly alter a target's 
senses. Illusions are taught by illusionists and some priests of chaotic gods.
Unlike other minor spheres, illusion spells do not require a major sphere. 


Lesson Two: Places of Learning
****************************************************************************
Most cities and towns have a place where you can learn each of the spheres
of magic. The elves of Haven have the Grand Library and their dark cousins
of Malveillant have the royal evoker and enchanter.  In Jidoor, there are
many mages that will teach a willing student.


Lesson Three: "How do I know what spells I can learn?"
****************************************************************************
The following command, spellhelp, will list the spheres of magic and the
spells they contain.  Using this help file, you will find a breakdown of
each of the spheres and their corresponding spells and skill level you need
to attain to cast the spell.

The following command, help allspells, will list every spell possible in
Kailie.  It will give the name, major magic sphere,it's corresponding skill
level, minor magic sphere (if one is needed) and it's corresponding skill
level.

Using either way, you will need to compare your current skill to either list.

The following is a list of newbie spells that you never leave home without:

barkskin                natural magic   1
condense air            natural magic   1       evokation       1


Lesson Four:  "How do I learn spells now?"
******************************************************************************
Okay you have found a spell teacher.  Good.  Now you need to ask this teacher
which sphere of magic he/she can teach.  The command is as follows

Ask <teacher> to teach

Now you need to ask this teacher how to teach the spells you can learn. The
command is as follows

Ask <teacher> to teach <spell name>


Lesson Five: Training
******************************************************************************
Before we begin this, one thing, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PERFECTLY CAST A
SPELL ONCE YOU LEARN IT.  You need to practice a spell several times before
you will be able to cast a spell correctly.  Every spell has a chance of
failure even if you think you know it perfectly.  Practice all your spells
on creatures with a weakness for magic like birds, chipmunks, dogs, and small
children, disregard the last part.  The command for casting spells:

Cast <spell name>

Some spells require a target. That command is:

Cast <spell name> on <target>

Warnings:
When you cast a spell and it does not work, you may get sick, or fall down,
or faint, etc.  When this happens do not worry unless you are fighting gang of
skeleton warriors.

Good Luck, Walskal.
