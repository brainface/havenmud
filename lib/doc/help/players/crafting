  You can "craft" some simple items. Some vendors around the world and some 
hidden places around the world contain recipes you can find. "Read"ing these 
recipes will give you knowledge of how to craft various items. You can see a 
list of your known recipes with the "recipes" command. Typing "craft torch" and 
so forth will attempt to craft a torch or whichever item from the first 
available itmes in your inventory.

  Some items (in particular, torches, simple lockpicks, and so on) are made 
with scrapped materials. You can attempt to "scrap" and item, and if you're 
knowledgeable enough about that type of material you will rip it apart and 
recieve a small amount of scrap metal, cloth, or wood.

  Doran in Sanctum is widely known to have a few simple craftin recipes for 
explorers.
