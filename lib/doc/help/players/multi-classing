Multi-classing is basically the ability to stack
two classes together to create a super class. Because
of the large amount of skills gained by multi-classing
advancement as a multi-classed character is much
slower than having a single class. The selection
of multi-class options are also very limited. But,
if one were so inclined, they could create a 
multi-classed character by joining one of the two
classes that compose the multi-class and saving up
100 development points (typically level 50) and then
approaching the leader of the second class and asking
to join. Please note that not all towns support all
classes, so multi-classing in some towns may not
be possible.
