   Agility

   This is a measure of how lithe and mobile your character is.  Anybody
   with a high agility has little problems dodging traps or leaping across
   chasms.  Agility directly affects how well your character defends themself
   in combat.  Anyone wishing to be a maneuverable fighter or thief should 
   have a high agility.
