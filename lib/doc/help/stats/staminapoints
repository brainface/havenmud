   Stamina Points   (sp)

   Stamina Points are how much energy your character has.  Once they get 
   low enough, you pass out and won't get up until some are recovered.  
   Stamina points are directly affected by your character's strength and are
   recovered over time.  Laying or sitting down accelerates the process.
