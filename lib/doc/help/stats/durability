   Durability

   This is a measure of your character's toughness.  Anyone with a high
   durability resists pain quite well and can take quite a beating
   before dying.  Durability directly affects your character's hit points,
   as well as the amount of damage they recieve in combat.  Anyone
   considering fighting should have a high durability.
