   Wisdom

   This is your character's ability to apply and use gained knowlege.
   Characters with a high wisdom should have little problem solving
   knowledge-based puzzles and planning strategies.  Wisdom directly
   affects your characters spell resistance, as well any faith based 
   ability.  Consequently, any character considering becoming a priest
   should have a high wisdom score.

   (NB: Characters who join a faith- or nature-based class will have
   their mps recalculated off of their wisdom stat, rather than their
   intelligence stat, to reflect the orientation of their classes.)
