   Coordination

   This is how well your character handles complicated activites.  Anyone
   that is coordinated has little problems juggling or picking a lock. This 
   also affects how accurate your character is in combat, particularly when
   fighting with two weapons, and how well you handle being drunk.  This is 
   a useful ability for any warrior or pickpocket.
