Focus: Knife combat, stealing, stealth (non-magical)

Roleplay: Rogues are miscreants who take pleasure in
stealing from others, stabbing people in the back and
generally sneaking around. They aren't necessarily evil,
but most people take offense when they find they have less
money than they thought they did. For these reasons, they
rarely fit into soceity and are often the target of law abiding
characters. They are reasonably good at combat, especially
knives. They are usually found in towns where law is of low
priority.

Difficulty: Easy
