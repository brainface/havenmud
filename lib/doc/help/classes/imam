Imam

Focus: Faith based magic with healing powers and trade

Roleplay: The Imam is a devout follower of the Kylin faith.
He is completely loyal to his faith, sometimes making him
a difficult character to roleplay. Imams are similar to clerics
but are Kylin only. They can become vastly powerful, given
the amount of combat skills they posess. They are exclusive
to the Emirate of Yozrath, and this location in the middle of
the desert makes them a difficult class to play for people new
to Haven.

Difficulty: Hard

Imams are UNIQUE to Yozrath.
