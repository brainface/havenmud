Focus: Hand to Hand combat

Roleplay: Barbarians are exclusive to backwards or tribal races.
          They are excellent warriors but are often reclusive and
          private hunters. Barbarians should be roleplayed within
          the bounds of their race and town, but never as advanced
          or "chivalrous" warriors.  Always keep in mind that 
          barbarians are primitives.

Difficulty: Easy
