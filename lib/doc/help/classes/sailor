Focus: Sailing, swimming, trade (non-magical)

Roleplay: The life of a sailor can be perilous. The seas of
Kailie can be harsh, so a sailor may find trouble on many
an occasion. They can make a lot of money transporting
goods and passengers from port to port. They have limited
combat abilities but can usually put up a decent fight if
provoked. Players will mostly be at sea unless they have
business on land, in which case they can usually be found
drunk in local inns. They can be found in most places with
ports.

Difficulty: Medium
