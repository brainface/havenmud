Focus: Defensive Combat

Roleplay: Acrobats are typically agile and lithe individuals
          with a knack for wriggling out of sticky situations.
          They focus primarily on winning a fight through 
          attrition rather than pure force. Adventurers who 
          choose the path of the acrobat are difficult to pin 
          down and are typically high energy individuals with 
          an inclination for the theatrical.

Difficulty: Medium
