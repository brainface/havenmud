Focus: Nature based magic user

Roleplay: Druids are the followers of the natural order. While they
          are usually Eclat in faith (due to the nature-focus of that
          religion), there are some minor exceptions. Druids should
          be played with a focus on nature, and their magic-only
          primary skill set allows them to be a powerful ally or a
          deadly foe.
