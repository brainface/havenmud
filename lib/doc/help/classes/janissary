Janissary

Focus: Projectile and Sword combat (non-magical)

Roleplay: Janissaries are the honour guards of the Sheikh of
Yozrath. They are completely devoted to defending him and
their faith. They are exclusive to the Emirate of Yozrath, and
this location in the middle of the desert makes them a difficult
class to play for people new to Haven.

Difficulty: Medium

Janissaries are UNIQUE to Yozrath.
