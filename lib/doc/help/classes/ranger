Focus: Natural based magic, projectile combat and stealth

Roleplay: Rangers are combat-type characters who prefer to
work on their own. They can often be found wandering the
land, learning about nature. They can become very powerful,
but at the price of long, hard work. Their balance between
magic and combat make them very useful in group situations.
They should be roleplayed with honour and loyalty.

Difficulty: Medium
