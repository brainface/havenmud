Focus: A limited mix of combat, magic, and stealth

Roleplay: Vampires are blessed or cursed, depending upon who you 
ask, with a parasitic form of undeath. Similiar to necromancers, 
they are not necessarily evil but often are--they must feed on 
the blood of living creatures to survive, and this feasting 
grants them power. They are found from dark abandoned crypts 
to grim castles to smoke filled backrooms of taverns of ill 
repute, but always in the shadows, for the light of the sun
slowly burns them to nothing.

Difficulty: High

Note: The Vampire class is in development and incomplete.
