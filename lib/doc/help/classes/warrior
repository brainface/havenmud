Focus: Sword and Unarmed combat (non-magical)

Roleplay: Warriors are usually found in primitve areas of the world where
there is no ranked military presence. They are completely combat orientated
and can do a lot of physical damage. Players who enjoy fighting rather than
thinking will have fun playing a warrior. Due to the primitive areas in 
which they can be found, warriors have the ability to fish and farm like 
everyone else.

Difficulty: Easy
