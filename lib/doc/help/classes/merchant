Merchant

Focus: Trade (non-magical)

Roleplay: Merchants can be very interesting characters to
roleplay. They are focused entirely on making money by
selling their products. Their skills also allow them to repair
items and sail, along with the ability to have a chance in
combat. This makes them valuable to most other players,
but also a fine target for thieves.

Difficulty: Medium
