Focus: Musical/Motion magic, stealth, seduction

Roleplay: The dancer class is a bard-like class of musical magic
          users. Their focus on stealth and knife attack also makes
          them a deadly combination. Dancers should be roleplayed as
          seductive creatures capable of fooling others into parting
          with their money. Dancers can be powerful friends or very
          unpleasant enemies due to this.  Dancers are only found in
          the Emirate of Yozrath, and this location in the middle of
          the desert makes them a difficult class to play for people
          new to Haven.
          
Difficulty:  Hard

Dancers are UNIQUE to Yozrath and Malveillant.
