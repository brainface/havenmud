   Wild-elves are one of the three offshoots of the 
   elven species. They have abandoned the ways of 
   the Lord of Order and the cities which their 
   cousins build, taking refuge in the Havenwood,
   where they conduct their supposedly heretical
   rites to Amelia, the Goddess of Nature and Love.

   Wild-elves enjoy a special protection from Amelia, 
   who hides their sleeping forms from the sight of 
   any who may harm them. In addition, their focus 
   on revelry and music gives them an innate 
   resistance to loud noises and sonic attacks.
