   indistinguishable. The main difference comes from
   the attitude exhibited by the races. The dark-dwarves
   are extremely violent and devious, embracing the
   fundamental ideals of the Soirin religion. They
   are short and stocky creatures with massive
   tufts of hair covering their heads and faces. They
   live in the town of Dalnairn on the island of
   Averath.
