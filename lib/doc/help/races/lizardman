   The lizardmen of the Gwonish Swamp are large bipedal
   lizards. Like other lizards, they are covered in
   scales which are green and have a tail and snout.
   Their society is of a tribalistic nature and they
   tend to be very savage in their dealings with
   trespassers on their swampland. Their strange
   appearance and aggressive nature has lead the
   other races to look upon the lizardmen with a mix of
   fear and loathing. The proximity of their swampland
   home to that of the Halfling village of Lloryk has
   led the two races to despise the existence of each
   other.

   Lizardmen are highly resistant to disease, and have 
   a natural ability to regenerate lost limbs over 
   time, a vexing concern to many a halfling warrior.
