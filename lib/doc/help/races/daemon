  Daemons are creatures born of chaos.  Like their cousins,
  the demons of the Lower Planes, the daemons are a race of
  creatures dedicated solely to destruction. Although the
  race of daemons bears a resemblence to their larger kin, 
  the daemons that walk upon Kailie are lesser creatures and
  must still contend with life as mortals. Their power and
  abilities will depend entirely upon their choices.
  
  ROLEPLAY
  
  Daemons are creatures of pure chaos in motion. They strive
  for personal power and do not choose long term goals with
  tremendous care. In short, daemons are very impulsive beings
  that are known for their great power... but may not be able
  to tell that making an ally today might reap rewards in the
  future.  People playing daemons should avoid inter-player
  alliances and should focus their character on short-term
  goals rather than long term planning.  
  
  Daemons are creatures of chaos and evil. No daemon has ever
  considered the possibility of Order or Balance in the world,
  and no daemon has ever fallen in love.  Flowers are for eating
  or possibly burning and art is something that can be used for
  mopping up spills.  Daemons do not appreciate irony. Daemons
  do not pine for the old days, nor do they think that muezzin
  are cute.  Unless cute means, "tastes better with catsup."
