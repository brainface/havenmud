   
   Sprites are small creatures averaging between a foot 
   to a foot and half in height. They have small 
   translucent wings upon their backs and tend  to hover 
   about rather than walk or run.  They are very 
   intelligent and quite fast, making good scouts, 
   messengers and sometimes, even spies. Although they 
   are obviously not physically endowed with strength they 
   have astonishing potential with regards to magic and 
   dexterous activities. They are known to be some of the 
   greatest mages in all of Kailie. In their understanding 
   of magic, Sprites know how to use magic to its fullest 
   and how best to defend against it. They live with the
   Lamrani in the city of Jidoor and practice the Magildan
   religion.
