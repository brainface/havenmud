Gelflings are similar to the race of elves in
appearance. They are small and joyous creatures
with extremely capricious attitudes and lifestyles.
Their flighty nature leads them to be very unreliable
but fun at social gatherings. Similar to some species
of insects, gelfling females are born with small 
wings while the males are not.
