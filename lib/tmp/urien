Ok, good news. I believe the problem with the room is the campfire.
I think im going to work around the void heart beat since thats 'essentially'
the thing thats eating the items and just leave it as a lightsource/item\


I tried twice, i would spam the room, everything would be ok. Once the fire emote 
triggered, the items would disappear. So its somewhere in there.

Just so you know: ~urien/ruins/room/armoury

Ill keep you posted.
