Did estates go away and I wasn't aware of it?  Or do they time out or something?

I logged on today and my estate was ...gone.  :)  So I walked around and I noticed all the other estates I remember the locations of are also gone.  

I checked the news but of course the news doesn't go back to when estates went in to reread the rules.  I'll check the helpfiles though too.

Thanks!
