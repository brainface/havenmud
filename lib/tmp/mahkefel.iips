Now deal a good bit more damage--the amount should be on the level of spells. Combat rage, strength, weapon class all affect this, and your cleric may not have awesome amounts of any of those but it still should be a decent amount higher than before.

I might wind up throwing in some drawbacks to make up for actions essentially being scaling, cheap spells, so don't expect anything to remain to static.

(Some things may increase in stamina cost, fumbles may hurt worse, etc.)

I'm... unhappy with swashbuckling having no low level damage dealer, so I'm probably knocking lunge to level 1 and maybe raising buckle, though none of that affects you.
