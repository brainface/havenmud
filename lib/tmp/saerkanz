Hi Duuk,

I just wanted to give you a heads up. I discovered Haven about three days ago and went on a binge of trying out different race and class combos. Consequently, I had five or six characters in my links. I wasn't happy with several of. Therefore I've been killing them off by having them die horribly twice in a row --you know the drill. Now I'm down to a manageable three or four and can try out new ones while using the names again. I guess it's kind of neurotic, but one thing it isn't or at least doesn't mean to be, is cheating. I never took gold or items from one caracter and gave them to another, or in any way let one of my characters benefit from the death of another. Please write me if I've committed a sin in all of this, although having an account system where you could more easily add and delete characters would be a great thing in my opinion.

Thanks for all the fish.

Bill / Saerkanz / Arkeilon / etc.
