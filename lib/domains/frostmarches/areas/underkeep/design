The Underkeep

Theme:

A powerful mortal, a long time ago, plundered the whole earth and amassed a huge horde of treasure. As he grew near to death, he called for his most trusted councillor, who was a powerful necromancer, to seal him in an underground tomb with all his worldly wealth. He also had his advisor to cast great magics around, binding his personal bodyguard to him even in death. There are a variety of traps to catch the unwary.

NPCs:

The NPCs will mainly consist of skeletons (blokey's personal bodyguard) and a few rats and things.

Treasure:

Vast hordes of money, which unfortunately have almost no value whatsoever in modern times due to inflation. The odd decent bit of armour etc.

Level Range:   10-55
