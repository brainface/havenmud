elemental.c -- fixed grammer in SetLong(), made SetWander() a reasonable
value.

icemage.c -- made level less random so that the long can approximate how hard it is and it can be, in general, expected of a certain level.

iceminstrel.c--balanced level.  frozen ppl don't fight well.

nymph.c -- make it valkyr, not animal.
	also made it an NPC, it didn't have any sentient functions but
	still inherited LIB_SENTIENT;

wolf.c -- made the wander reasonable.
