giant_snake.c:  Just realized something in the long and die ... "it" shld be "he"
             etc.
giant_spider.c:  replace "it" w/ she, her, etc.
kara.c:  "Druidic","Druidism" ... caps are imp. (:
kara.c:  She says that the path north is blocked by weeds, etc, right?
	Well, what you shld do is have an AddExit("north",(whatever room
	this is), (: PreExit :) ... and then have a PreExit defined that
	never lets them pass, just tells them that the path is blocked.
spirit_warrior.c:  Long, grammer.  "without sleep for a long time" instead.
kara.c:  Note the note about the preexit.  We'll promote you to immortal
and finish the entire area and *then* add that.
