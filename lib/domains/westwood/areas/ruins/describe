Summary
~~~~~~~

 Ancient forgotten ruins in the westwood. The creator 
 of the castle had big plans but halfway through it was
 abandoned and forgotten about. Vaguley mentions mortals
 that made tapestries of the first GodsWar. 
 
 Now some vagabonds have moved in, it smells horrible,
 but treasure could possibly lie here.

ROOMS
~~~~~
 
Location Desired, going with the original design of 
Gabriel with this one. Top right corner of the 
Westwood forest. These will be friendly npc's and 
will be able them to explore it too.

Mostly going to be rooms running off the skeleton rooms 
in the domain i found. 

Roughly 11 rooms, maybe a little more.

NPC
~~~

 Good aligned spirits and some NPC's which moved in since 
 the castle "never finished". Thinking a good aligned 
 wanderer or three.

 All will be Muezzin.
 
 Roughly 5 NPCs.

OBJ
~~~

Armour will be very standard nothing spectacular. Going 
to add some long socks. Leather, reinforced, wood, and 
lower class tiered armour.

Treasure
~~~~~~~~

Going to have one decent treasure:
  Scroll when read sends you to your townhall!


Creator Notes OOC
~~~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~

Abandoned Ruins area i stumbled upon implemented in the 
/domains/westwood directory, but not connected. Apparent 
plans for Haven that either got lost or nuked. Lets restore
them, with heavy modification. Reno mentioned this was 
completed, so assessment leads to this being lost 
and unrestored.

Orig 'plans' from Gabriel were skeleton. est. 10/07/99
   - 11 "working" rooms - 3 had Long Descs
                        - 1 went nowhere
   - 5 OBJ, 1 lake 2 fish npc/food files
   - /domains/westwood/virtual/westwood/25,29 only 
        referenced room which i expanded on a 
        little bit for flavor.
   
Turned the moat into the ruined moat. Will tie in with 
any potential border from the Yozrath desert. Also 
waterfalls are nice. Hidden rooms are even nicer.

Tucking in some things needed. Clothes for small players 
and some weapons to not leave large/med out either.
