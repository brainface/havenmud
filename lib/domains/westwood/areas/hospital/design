HOSPITAL
--------

THEME:  Small, two story building in the WestWood.  Nice white walls, all 
	of that, but with homey touches here and there.

NPCs:	The NPCs will be hospital workers (clerics who mend the patients 
	somtimes) and the sick themselves, who are poisoned or merely 
	low in hp.  A few visitors of these sick.

TREASURE:  Not much.  A few items which heal and maybe one strong NPC 
	with a unicorn horn or other magical items like that.  An 
	antidote, too, and some money.

LEVEL:  Designed more for giving those with the "healing" skill a chance 
	to raise healing in an IC sort of way.  Is it really realistic to
	be hurting oneself so that one can practice healing oneself?  The 
	sick will be low levels, of course, and the doctors getting higher 
	and such.
