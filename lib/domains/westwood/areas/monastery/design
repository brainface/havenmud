MONASTERY
---------

THEME:  A monastery in the WestWood.  It's brightly lit at all times, and 
	has a joyous atmosphere around it.  There's a garden in back, not 
	of great size but with many beautiful flowers and trees and such.
	A temple of Eclat is inside, also.

NPCs:  Monks, priests, worshipping muezzins, that sort of stuff.  A couple 
	bugs in the garden, and maybe some pet type things.

TREASURE:  Robes, other clothing from the muezzins.  Some cuicui, but 
	not much.  A few special objects that were blessed by Amelia.

LEVEL:  15-25 PC.  20-40 NPC.
