The Dark Pyramid

  Theme:
    A dark pyramid standing deep inside the frostmarches...

  NPCs:
    Some mummies, bats, maybe a couple of undead nosferatus, prolly some animals related to egyptian culture too. I was also thinking about putting some class leaders according to egyptian religion (e.g. a necro leader called Anubis, a diviner called Thot...)

  Treasure:
    Some crystals in the npcs, and valuable gems in the leaders.

  Level Range: about 15-18 the npcs, the leaders would be 35-40
