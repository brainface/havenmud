Gwonish Swamp:

Theme:

Gwonish Swamp is near the barbarian village of Lloryk where it's
denezians occasionally raid for food(usually children or livestock
from the village.)

NPCs:
Lizardmen and perhaps a troll or two.  Also some mundane animals
that reset randomly.

Treasure:
Mostly mundane equipment that they have stolen during raids - not
a lot though, because they are more interested in food than treasure.
The trolls however will have a small cache of valuables.

Level Range:  3 - 6
