Area: Addition to Glimmerdin Mines
Date Started: December 17, 1998
Date Completed: 

Theme:
This area's theme will involve mines that will run
underneath the town of Glimmerdin.  This area will
not include a town or village, it will more so
concentrate on creating and/or extending the mines
that currently run throught the Glimmerdin area.  

NPCs:
I plan on having a few NPCs, which are to include a
few miners, along with some random "things" that you
would find in a cave, or mine.    

Treasure:
I would include few loose items, but would include
some on the NPCs themselves.  Examples: mining picks,
shovels, knives, and basic clothing.  

Target Levels:
This area would be targeted for players between levels
of 10-20

Location:
It will be located near the current mines in Glimmerdin.
