camp1.c:  looks nifty.
camp2.c:  in the DayLong, there is an extra space between of and colors.
fire1.c:  No one can see the discription for this since you have it in the Items,
          too.  i'd suggest removing the items one?
dog.c:  It doesnt exist, but it's in your Inventory.  I'm guessing you mean dog1.c
dog1.c:  Dont bother w/ this now, but in the future, use SetAdjectives() in your
         npc's and obj's instead of listing in the Id.
         Also, add this if you want, but SetMeleeAttackString() and
         SetMeleeDamageType() are nifty functions.  for the attack string, just
         whatever you want to show up as what he's hiting people with, like 
         "fists" or "claws".  for DamageType, you have to, up w/ the others
         #include <damage_types.h> ... and then pick the proper damage (: This
         is also not required but it's a nifty function.
camp3.c:  a couple extra spaces between attention. and A yellow wagon in DayLong.
          Items, "shadows" shld also include "shadow".
girl.c:  SetAction, if you call it twice, just rewrites waht you had in the first
         with the second.  Modify it into:  SetAction(5,({ "onethingyouwanthertodo",
         "anotherthingyouwanthertodo","yetanother","more" })); replacing those
         "yetanother" etc with actual strings  you can do as many or as few in
         on NPC as you want.
dress2.c:  For the wearable stuff, have you thought about adding repair code?
           this is another option, really, but most things should be repairable
           so that people can train their repair skills.  You set the material,
           as you've done, then you add in SetRepairDifficulty() and 
           SetRepairSkills(([])); ... RepDiff takes an interger, something low for
           a dress i'd imagine, and RepSkills takes a mapping, like:
           SetRepairSkills( ([
                               "textile working" : 0,
                          ]) );
           you put in any applicable skills, and for all armours, put in
           "armor smithing" and all weapons need "weapon smithing".
camp4.c:  grammar, "A bench rests between the wagons provides a nice place.."
          either 'rests' of 'provides' shld be changed to 'resting' or 'providing'
          (in the DayLong).  In the NightLong, extra period+missing space between
          'red wagon.. A bench'. 
          Couple typos in Items, in the 'flower', you say "The red is" .. probably
          "The red flower is.." and the 'bench', extra space in there.
camp5.c:  extra spaces in NightLong, "Most of  the area"  and "swapping stories,  "
          missing space in Items, "gypsies", in "dayof work." 
          On that note, we usually dont put living things into the Items.
man.c:  looks good (:
pants1.c:  good, good.
shirt1.c:  good.
tambourine1.c:  doesnt seem like a hack weapon really?
knife1.c:  needs a material.
           again, on these objects, possibly repair code?
drummer.c:  looks good.
drum1.c:  doesnt seem hackish to mean.
dancer.c:  in the Inventory, she'll only end up wieldling one knife.
dress1.c:  good.
dagger1.c:  good, nice repair code.
camp6.c:  add a Listen for the purple wagon, and music.
camp7.c:  extra spaces, 'up.    Scraps' (NightLong).
          Items, "red wagon", need a space between "driver'sseat"
          Note:  You're supposed to put in the plural and the singular for
          stuff in Items, and I've noticed it a few times in a couple rooms.
          I wouldn't worry about fixing it now, unless you've time or feel
          like it, but maybe once we've put it in the game and promoted you
          you could go back and fix it?  it happens lots. ~shrugs~ 
camp8.c:  looks good.
camp9.c:  good.
old_man.c:  good

I haven't gone through the trail or wagon files, but overall, I'd say you're
doing great. ~huggs~ (: G'luck, xera!
