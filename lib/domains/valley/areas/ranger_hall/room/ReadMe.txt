*** I ran out of time and only go through the two rooms

streambank.c
day long-
- "into deep forest" needs an article. Like "the" or "a"
or you could do "boulders, deeper into the forest"
- moss covered doesn't need the , after it.
"small, moss covered boulders"

night long-
- needs that first sentence changed also (like you did
with the day long)
- "small, dark boulders" works
- do "stream bed". it can be two seperate words.

trees - I still think this item description could
be reworked to be a little more flowing/more explicative.
Again, the trees are living, of course they'll have life-
like qualities. Maybe emphasize the sentient aspect instead?
Maybe "The trees have a weight of great age and majesty,
giving them an almost sentient presence as they watch over
the stream."

path.c
items
trees - same problem as in streambank. I'm ok with the
use in the set long, but the "look almost life-like"
doesn't work...again, they're already alive. concentrate
on the sentient aspect.

entrance.c
daylong -
- "large boulder surrounded by underbrush and several large
trees" would work here. You're missing a connection between
the two sentence halves. or "underbrush and there are"
- "imposing, yet embracing, feeling" that way the yet
is modifying imposing, and leaving imposing as an
adjective for feeling.

nightlong 
- "looms over" makes more sense.
- take the comma out of "large, trees"
