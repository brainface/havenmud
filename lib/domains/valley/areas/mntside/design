Jidoor Mountainside

  Coded by Aramuuk
Theme :
  The Jidoor Mountainside is to be set in the Crystal Reaches to the west
  and north of Jidoor. It will consist of a series of paths winding their
  way up the mountain with a number (at least two so far) of plataues 
  where more interesting things will be encountered.
NPCs:
  Savage Dwarves : A small band of dwarves who have "gone native" are the
  key element of this area. They will have constructed a number of small
  huts and have some terraced gardens, but will essentially be barabians.
  In addition some Goats (domestic and wild) and a few domesticated dogs
  will be encountered on the path and in the hut areas.
Treasure:
  Minimal. The dwarves don't much need money but will have some primitive
  weapons and armours (skins and worked clubs).
Level Range: 5-15
