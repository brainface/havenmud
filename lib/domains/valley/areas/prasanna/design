The Ancient Ruins:


Theme:

The ancient ruins is an area of ominous beauty, astonishing architecture, 
and elegant beauty southeast of Jidoor, hidden somewhere within the 
Crystal Reaches. Any traces of the former inhabitants are few and far 
between, yet the area seems to tingle with magical power. The ancient 
city is set upon a small mesa or plateau, and despite it's age, looks 
relatively untouched by time. The architecture of the ruins is huge, 
almost inhuman, and is rich with statues, marble pillars, arches, elevated 
walkways, etc. The motivation for exploring the ruins, beyond curiosity, 
lies in it's future, depending upon what I can add later...
(thinking along the lines of unique item or something of that sort)


NPCs:

The NPCs are going to be... a bit different. Their descriptions will show 
them to be something like... Phantoms, ghosts, or more aptly, "images" left 
behind...Ethereal Woman, Ethereal Child, etc.  Also there may be a few animals about of the same predicament, stuck somewhere between being "here" and "there".


Treasure:

Ancient relics, of relatively little value, unique items with no real power, 
perhaps an item that a certain NPC elsewhere values greatly?


Level Range:  

1 - 15, dependant if one chooses to attack the NPCs.
