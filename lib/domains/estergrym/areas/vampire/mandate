You go, "OoOoOoOOoOOoOO".

A large open space [north, south, east]
Light grey marble lines the walls and floor of this large open space, two rows of large darker pilars being the only break in lightness. The space seems to
stretch out endlessly to the east and west with no end to the rows of pilars visible from this point. Two shimmering portals hover here near the
northernmost and southernmost walls. A small, dark red cushion lays on the floor between them.
Duuk the Lord of Order is here.
