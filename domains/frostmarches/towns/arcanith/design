 
The Ruins of Arcanith:

   Theme:

      The Ruins of Arcanith are the remains of a long, lost city of magic.
      This will be the prime starting area for later adventures.  It was
      know as the city of light it still glows with a silvery radiance.
      The Town ruins are set upon a mountain.  Later levels will be within
      the mountain.


   NPCs:

      Mostly made of Kobolds.  A few spiders and snakes.  A druid to protect
      a special tree.  Finally, some tougher guardian monsters to guard
      enterances to deeper dungeons.

   Treasure:

      The ruins have been well searched so very little treasure should be
      found.  The kobolds will have a few coins.  Guardian creatures will
      have a little more treasure.  One enchanted item will be found in
      the ruins.

   Level Range: 1-5; This area should be a basic area for all mortals.
