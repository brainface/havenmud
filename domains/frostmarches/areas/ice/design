The iceland

  Theme:

    Based entirely on ice and snow, this area (probably somewhere near Grymx) has NPCs, items and area that are defensively boosted for ice, and a little more hurt by fire.

  NPCs:
    Yetis, wolves, any other animal that can add a "snow" adjective...

  Treasure:
    On the NPCs, armor and weapons geared toward ice.  The armor will have little slash, pierce, or blunt type defense, with protection mostly for magic and ice.  The weapons will also be ice damage.

Levels:
  Probably for PCs around 10ish level, the NPCs will be anywhere from 20-50 level.
