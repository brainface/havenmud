Theme:

Sort of an orcs vs. humans area, with an emphasis on the fighter class.
Will have NPC's with decent hack and blunt defenses, as well as weapons for those
skills.  Will also have helmets (which are sorely needed) and
Full Plate Mail, which is real heavy but provides a ton of protection
against almost anything.

NPCs:
Regular Human Footsoldiers, Orc Footsoldiers, a higher ranking human, and a higher ranking orc.  There will be a few rooms where the orcs have set up camp, a few battlefield rooms with humans and orcs, and a small besieged human outpost.  The orc cap'n will be in the orc camp, and the human captain in the human camp.

Treasure:
There ought to be a tiny amount of money in the human and orc centers.  The real attraction, i think, will be the ability to raise skills and get some good items.

Level Range:
4-10
