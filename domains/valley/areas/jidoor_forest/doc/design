 Jidoor Forest
 
    Theme:
 
	Jidoor Forest is set deep in the woods southwest of Jidoor not too
	far from Jidoor road.  It is home to an old mage who tells many stories of
	the faith of Magildans and of the building of Jidoor itself (some of which
	are obviously false, some of which might lead the adventure to look for
	other areas based on a hint).  He will also be an astrologer.
  
    NPCs:
 
	The main NPC will be P'alirith.  He will be a level 40 Diviner and will be
	a fierce opponent for any that mage his level.  The Keep itself will have an
	benign undead spirit roaming around the rooms.  The forest around the keep has
	the standard forest animals **all except for the lair of an ancient dragon 
        (lvl 40) who calls himself Naluris.  He will be a tough fight for most 
        mortals**.
 
    Treasure:
 
        P'alirith will have a fairly sizable treasure consisting of a few thousand 
        rounds, rupies and imperials.  He will also wield a magical mace.  
	** Naluris will have a fairly sizable hoard including a substancial sum of 
        rounds, imperials and rupies.  His treasure will also includ a few sought 
        after items including a few magical rings and a magical container.
