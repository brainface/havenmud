         * History
            - Split from Duuktsaryuth's elves during start of GodsWar.
            - Went off in search of power and prestige and a more active
                   role in the war.
            - Ended in Barian jungle and created a small village.
            - They started to gain power and make an impact 
                   (not very elf-like) causing disapproval from 
                   Duuktsaryth.
            - The dark-elves wouldn't follow his ways, and grew in power.
            - Finally Duuktsaryth had ignored them long enough and instead
                    of the praise they wanted, he "zapped" their town and 
                   banished them to an underground domain.
            - This act of disownment led the dark-elves to worship another : 
                    Portia : Princess of Darkness  (subject to change)
            - It is only with her re-appearance that the dark-elves have begun
                   to rise from their underground domain and interact with 
                   the rest of Kailie.
