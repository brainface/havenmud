In your hell items add the following line:

	SetProperty("magic", "what ever message you want it to give");

black_robe.c
	the protections need to be toned down a bit.

mummy_nw.c
	Typo in the long "Holding a a heavy mace..."
	also what is medium sized?  give me a better size description
	like the size of a short human or something

monk.c
	lose the conjuring in this guy faith and conjuring are out of theme




NPCs in general
	be careful when using ansi, make sure it is required.
	make sure to SetMorality in your npcs
	also almost all of your npcs are set to 15 + random(7)
		I don't buy it that a bat is the same level as the large demon.
		make the levels more appropriate.
