  Originally written by Balishae in October of 1997, Glimmerdin
  has always had a troubled history of code, recode, and abandonment.
  In September of 2004, Duuk finally decided to adopt dwarves as a primary
  race for the Kylin religion and recoded Glimmerdin.
  With luck, dwarves will become a positive influence on the mud.
