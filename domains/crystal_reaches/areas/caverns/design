Dragonflight's Big Idea

For Angelhood Area:
Okay my basic idea revolves around the mysteries and intrigue of the dark and 
thus caverns/caves. So Initially I will make a series of paths, tunnels, and 
caves.  I have a bear's den near right next to the entrance and a little off 
of a beaten path a gnome's burrow.  Deep into the first level there will be a 
kobold den/burrow/encampment, however you like to think of it.  Near to this 
kobold section a path will lead down to the 2nd Level of the caverns.  Here I 
plan to put an Old hag, which I may update latter if able to (just a thought 
of mine).  To end my area there will be a great chasm and from the ledge a man 
is building a bridge over to the other side.  This hopefully will keep the 
players interested in my area and want to come back latter on after I finish 
the second part of it.  I am also going to put in some other creatures so that 
there is something else here: Bats, and other such creatures.

I have an idea of some things that will come latter on but that isn't till the 
5th to 7th levels of these caves.  But basically I want my caverns to increase 
in difficulty as the level you are on increases.  And currently I don't really 
have much of an idea of what I will put past this angel area, but I'm sure I'll 
think of something.

Levels:  Newbie, maybe really low Mortal.  I'm thinking Lvs 1-5

Treasures:  Not much of anything to be found here (what do kobolds have anyways)

NPCs:  Old hag, bridge builder, Gnome, Bear & cubs, Kobolds - chief, warriors, 
others.
