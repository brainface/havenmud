fortuneteller:  you shld only be adding the spells she uses ....
baby, boy, ok.
girl, dancer, dog 1&2, ok.
leader.c:  Missing space, long.

Considering that we have a gypsy class, I'd suggest making at least the big
characters in this camp gypsies. If you need to add a skill or two so they
have the spells you want them to, that's fine.  But as a player, I'd expect
your leader to have knife defense, meaning i'd try to train knife on him,
but he actually doesnt,  ...  you see?

men are all ok.
musician ok.
old_man:  extra space in Long
teen:  extra space in Long

instruments:  add in "bard_instrument" in Id.
pants2.c:  extra space in Long
shirt1.c:  The cuffs are fitted to be sure they dont get caught?  By what?  Eh?

           the symols, goes here.");
