Theme: 
The gypsy camp is meant to be placed somewhere along Balzor road, but it's a gypsy camp so it can really go anywhere.  A wide, fairly short trail will lead up to the camp.  The camp itself will be made up of brightly colored wagons surrounding a fire pit.  There may be other fire pits and small bunches of wagons together as well.  

NPCs:
Several gypsies will be wandering around varying in strength, age, and sex.  Some domestic animals will also be around such as goats and chickens.  Mainly small animals that are easy to transport.  

TREASURE: 
The gypsies will be clothed of course.  Some (mainly males) will carry weapons (cheap ones) like knives and staves.  Some of the young females will carry daggers.  Others will have instruments such as tambourines.  Small trinkets may be found in some of the wagons.
