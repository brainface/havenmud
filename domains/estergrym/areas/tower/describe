Summary
~~~~~~~
Almost overnight a warped black tower has risen from the 
depths of the earth and began its blackness over the 
area.

Animals which have previously inhabited the land have been 
turned into undead beings and are extremely aggressive and
have abnormal powers, such as super strength.

It can be seen in the Estergrym Mountain base in which 
you will have to travel through a cave to get to the tower 
itself.


ROOMS
~~~~~
Roughly 35 rooms. 18 outside 18 on the inside. It breaks
the x and y barriers forcing the player to go 'up' into 
the tower to apprehend the vile necromancer, northwest, 
and split pathways are also included. Climb staircases,
hidden exits and all that fun stuffs.

ROOM ORDER (Named to be "in order"
Cave -> Tower Outside -> Tower
cave ->      tout     -> twer

NPC
~~~

High Necromancer- (80 +rand 7)

Raised this tower from the ground with his mental powers. 
His incursion on the land suffocates its very being. 
Making breaking into the tower a task.

Shrieker- (68 rand +5)
With every experiment comes the ultimate success. This 
is the High Necromancers most prized summon. With the 
shrieker's long blade-like fingernails she can disarm
opponents with ease. Also her small frame makes her 
very fast compared to a normal human.

Necromancer Apprentice- (75 +rand 5)
The assistant to evil in this twisted tower. 

Mummy- (55 + 5)
Summoned by the High Necromancer, these guys will guard
him with their lives, after they die cloth will replace
the corpse.

Skeleton Warriors- (50 +rand 15)
Spawned from the necromancer apprentice with his semi
limited powers, they will have a random weapon and a 
shield to guard the apprentice from harm. When these
guys die, they leave a pile of ash and blow away.

Some however have been freed from the Necromancer's 
control and roam the halls for some adventurers to 
bring back to his master.

Walking corpse- (40 +rand 7)
From the failed experiments grabbing travellers off 
the road, these corpses wander around the tower with 
a slow movement. Not necessarily zombies, the corpses 
do not desire flesh or blood. They wander in agony with 
hatred toward the living.


OBJ
~~~
Most of the NPC's listed above besides the necromancers
will be naked. The walking corpses will have shredded
and battered clothing from their turning. 

Skeletons will have old heavy shields that have seen 
a better day. Covered in dust and age these armour 
items will not hold up well in combat. Some will have
helmets/gloves of the same quality. All skeletons will
have a rusted longsword.

Necromancer's robe- With every mage comes his own 
personal robe. Made from the flesh of his victims and
held together with strands of hair. Not intended to 
wear in combat, but provides great magical protection
against fire. 

Another treasure is a wooden ring which the magical 
demon turns into after you kill him. It is large sized
and offers only slight protection in blunt combat.


Treasure
~~~~~~~~

Amoung all of the treasures listed above, the High
Necromancers robe is said to be the most valuable.
Contrary to skin being flammable, this robe offers
the contrary, some flame resistance.

Diamond shaped ruby encased in gold and linked together
with golden chain. It glows softly and is rumored to 
have come from the lower planes itself. Who or what 
had forged this remarkable amulet is not known.
(Slight hunger resilience)

Most of the obj's here will be just junk to weigh 
down the players as they advance through the tunnels.
I was nice enough to build a chest to fill with junk.


Creator Notes OOC
~~~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~

Players are really going to like and hate this area.
The Necromancer and the apprentice will most likely
cause some grief for the reward, but the area will 
also fill the gap needed desperately in Duuk's post
which haunts my dreams. (lvl 40 - 80 Requirement)

The NPCs wander, and they are aggro. When you are 
trying to kill the main bosses they will wander 
right into the room you are healing and cause 
some serious grief. The necro summons his undead 
minions and even curses you. Enjoy!

Special thanks to Mahkefel, Duuk,
Melchezidek (Quality Control), and Torak for 
putting in some extra time to help me with this.
It's been a long time coming.
