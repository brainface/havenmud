urien's tower approval stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--DONE--Fix your SetItems to be nouns only and add SetItemAdjectives

--DONE--when you make items, you no longer have to state, 'room::create'
nor, 'npc::create' now all you have to do is use, '::create'

--DONE-- change /rooms/ dir to /room/

--DONE--never ever do this : SetInventory(([ TOWER_OBJ "skull" : 1]));
in one line like this. future people who add things will just
curse your name.

--DONE--your rooms in the tower, the torches along the wall.
make these actual objects that radiate light with a
SetPreventGet("nailed to the wall, stupid.");
you'll thank me when you play a druid that can create a
meal that looks light a lit torch.  remeber to remove
SetradiantLight() form the room files.

--DONE--twer08 - 10.c remove the stairway from the room files and create a real
stairway you climb up/down.

--DONE--twer11 - no road.  singular\plural walls.  Estergry->Estergrym in window
capitalize Mountains. no tower.  add 'view' to the 'window' item. there is
no lair.  add, 'wood' for 'throne' item.  add 'runes' for 'doorway' item.
