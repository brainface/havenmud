Intoductory Skaven Area

Theme -

A relatively small area designed to hopefully
acquaint the general populace of Haven with what I would
like to see as a new player race, the evil Skaven.
The area would be a small Skaven outpost near a civilized area,
basically like an underground burrow.  If any cities
actually have a sewer system coded (I doubt it) it could
be connected there.

NPCs - 

Some giant rat "pets" to begin with, then perhaps a few Skaven
peons, who are there to support the tougher Stormvermin (fighters)
and perhaps a Gutter Runner (Assassin) running the show.  If
I get ambitious, there could even be a packmaster who cares
for the giant rats, and maybe even a brutish Rat Ogre

Treasure - 

Relatively little, perhaps a small amount of currency from
the nearby town, some relatively mundane equipment, and
maybe one or two halfway decent magical weapons.

Levels -

Depending on how much is actually finished, I would say level 3-5
players should be able to handle the giant rats and slaves
while probably 10-20 would be more suited to the warriors,
and possibly 20-50 if there are further "specialists" added.
