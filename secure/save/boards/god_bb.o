Which leads to...  SHIPS ARE BACK IN!  For now, players can't own them.  But they will, oh yes, they will.  For now, the Inner Sea is a straight line from Haven Town to Averath,  and there is a ferry that starts at the Haven Wharf and goes back and  forth.  This journey takes a while, be prepared to listen to players  whine about the time.  Tell them to suck it up, the trip is free :D  I have a few people working on \"maps\" for me so I can make the full  oceans this week.  I intend on actual ports in Haven Town, Parva,  Sanctum, the ruins of Lloryk, Baria, Keryth, and Tairi.  I'll have  \"coastal\" areas for players to land their ships which may or may not  actually connect to anything useful in Kailie, but it's not out of  the realm of the possible for me to link them.  The world of Kailie will be ROUND, meaning a player that sails far  enough east or west will reach the other side of the world.  This  means for you that once I get the oceans and seas in, you can code  islands and artic wastelands.  You may assume that Kailie is much  like our world, with an equator near the north end of Averath and  arctic zones on the north and south edges.  Please keep this in mind when thinking of projects for newbie Imms.  Averath is a restricted domain.

They will pickone of three cities (HavenWood, Baria, or Frostmarches) and create a threeroom area.  Before coding, it is recommended that their sponsor or another sage+go over their idea to make sure it fits with the theme of the city.  This areamust also include a couple npcs and objs.  Once the area is complete, the angelshould have their sponsor or another sage+ look over it for gross errors.  Finalapproval requires Amelia or Laoise.The hope is that angels won't just make something like \"a farmhouse\" with \"boy\",\"girl\" and \"mommy\".  We want unique and interesting stuff--stuff like rat on a stick.  Once the area is approved, the angel becomes an immortal.A few more details for the angels out there...1.  Nothing outside of the create function.2.  No more than 10 *files*.  3 rooms.  The rest can be split between your	NPCs and OBJs.  If you want something bigger, do it when you're an imm.	You can also get permission to add on to your angel area later.3.  No complex stuff.  Keep it simple.  Make your area interesting by having	funny NPCs or OBJs, or really good descriptions.4.  To the east of your workroom is a small teaching room.  Looking at it can	help you.5.  Recoding your workroom can also help, as can looking at files for areas	that you used to play in.  This will teach you what the code looks	like for a room you're familiar with.6.  Be nice to your fellow angels, and all the other immortals--especially	those that will be doing Quality Control on all your areas (Amelia 	and Laoise).  They can all help answer your questions, but they	won't if you're a BadWord<tm>.And After Promotion....-----------------------We aren't interested in huge areas.  We have enough, and big spaces in between.Before an immortal starts to plan a big, complex castle, we want to stop them.It takes a lot more work than it seems it will.  So, first, we want immortalsto code a few small areas.  Not as small as the angel projects, but somethingaround 10 rooms or so.If you, as an immortal, think you're ready for something more--talk it over with your sponsor.  They may be willing to give the go ahead for your largerproject.  Alternatively, think of splitting it down into two smaller areas thatyou fuse together when you've finished both--and make each of them good,stand-alone areas.","read":({"nauzo","alessandra","laoise","amelia","cyric","zeddicus","vaux","dahaka","vanyel","duuk","liranae","davantalus","zaxan","artanis",}),"time":1089073949,"subject":"Angels",]),(["author":"Amelia","post":"On another note--Laoise and I are the ApprovalChics<tm>.

Use a test char.  Make sure	your merchant actually sells and buys stuff.  Make sure	your npcs are wearing their clothes and wielding their	weapons.  Look at things.  Step Three:  Readable Code.	If your approval team has to work hard to just be able to	read your code and find your descriptions, they will	tell you to redo it.  That's it.  You don't pass go or	collect any notes on the other stuff, and you have to	wait until they have time--again.  Look at the example	rooms you've been given on what readable code looks like.		It also helps use get through your code if you use 	reasonable file names.  while descriptive, \"3_room_angel	_project\" is a pain to keep typing in.  It's also hard	to find a specific room if all the files are \"room1\" through	\"room50\".  	Another thing you'll find on Haven is that npcs, objs,	and rooms are all split into different directories, generally	called \"npc\", \"obj\" and \"room\".  Also, for ease of moving	areas around (such as out of your /realms directory and	into /domains), we use aliases for all file references.	Ask your sponsor how to make a \".h\" file if you don't	know already.  Step Four:  Grammar and Spelling.	Copy your descriptions into spellcheck if you have problems	with this.  Have a friend read it over.  Your approval staff	should not be giving you fifty pages of notes on this.Step Five:  Balance.	A tiny piece of paper doesn't weigh 50 kg.  A harmless rat	can't kill a level 10 player.  Use a test char.  Make it	level 10.  Try to kill the rat.  If you fail, you need to 	make changes.Step Six:  Thorough Item and Adjective lists.	If the long description in a room talks about a box of	nifty flowers, I can:	\"look at box\" \"look at flowers\" \"look at flower\" \"look at 	box of flowers\" \"look at box of nifty flowers\" \"look at 	nifty flower\" \"look at nifty flowers\"	We used to have to do this the hard way (by typing all	that out) so don't complain.  You have SetItemAdjectives().Step Seven:  Descriptions.	The approval staff shouldn't fall asleep reading your	descriptions.  Neither should the players.  Rooms should	include information about what exits and enters are	around.  NPCs should include information about how	difficult they are to kill, what their skills, morality,	religion, town, race, etc. are.  OBJs should include	information about their size, composition (iron, wood,	etc.), and use are.	To keep us awake, try to put something interesting to	look at in each room.  Make your NPCs say nifty things.	One easy way to do this is to put at least one unique	thing in each room--a cool mural on the wall in the	rich merchant's home, for example.  Make funny items,	like the famous rat-on-a-stick.Step Eight:  Listen and Smell.	All rooms should have a default listen and smell.	All things that are smelly, like piles of rotting	food, should be smell-able.  All things that are noisy,	like waterfalls, should be listen-able.  Step Nine:  Navigation.	The long description should describe all the exits and	enters.  They should also give a general idea of where	those exits and enters go--into a building, through a	forest, along a road.  The area should not be difficult	for me to map out.  Also, if I can walk east into a 	room, I should be able to walk west back out of it, and	into the room I originally came from.Step Ten:  Theme.	The area should fit our theme.  Magic.  Swords.  No guns.	No computers.  Realism.Step Eleven:  Fully Coded.	There are a lot of properties to set in an NPC or an OBJ.	Properties like morality and religion often get overlooked,	but some spells are based off of them.  Other things to	consider:		An npc that is proficient in slash attack should			also be proficient in slash defense.		A mage should use spells in combat.		A rat should use teeth and claws to attack.		Merchants (and sentient people in general) are			probably carrying some money.		A swordmaster is probably carrying, and using,			a sword.	These properties add a lot of cool functionalist to the	mud.  Players like it when their \"kill rats\" spell works	on the rat.Step Twelve:  Fun.	Believe it or not, people play Haven because it is fun.	Make an area that you would enjoy playing, and other	players will probably enjoy it, too.	It's also worth considering what players \"get\" for using	your area.  Are there good NPCs to train with?  Will	they get lots of treasure for purchasing things?  Or will	they get some sort of spiffy, useful item?  Or are things	fun to look at and role-play with?Step Thirteen:  Politeness.	Don't tell the approval staff to fuck off when you get a 	list of stuff to fix.  Don't act like it is stupid or	beneath you.  If you really feel this way, then coding	for Haven is not for you.  Go back to being a player.	","read":({"nauzo","alessandra","laoise","amelia","cyric","zeddicus","vaux","dahaka","vanyel","duuk","liranae","davantalus","zaxan","artanis",}),"time":1089174615,"subject":"QC Stuff",]),(["author":"Duuk","post":"  Amelia's post rocks all.  That'll be a help file shortly.","read":({"nauzo","alessandra","laoise","amelia","cyric","zeddicus","vaux","dahaka","vanyel","duuk","liranae","davantalus","zaxan","artanis",}),"time":1089175337,"subject":"Amelia",]),(["author":"Zaxan","post":"The spell list daemon has been changed so it now lists spells organized byspheres (which are resolved and alphabetized).

Please read this over because I plan onstarting the coding on this soon and I want to solve thetough problems regarding do we even have boards anymore andhow OOC do we want to make the 'news' cmd?I plan on writing up a new system that integrates boards and newsgroups.They will work as follows:The 'news' command will allow immortals to read the posts from allthe different boards as well as allow both immortals _and_ players tosetup up post notifications for individual groups. The two types ofnotifications are:- Notify me if I have unread posts when I logon- Notify me when a new post is made while I'm logged inBoards will tie in together with this system so reading thetown.jidoor group will have the same information as whenyou read the board object with ID=town.jidoor.Each board will have a multitude of options such as:- Town restriction- Race restriction- Guild restriction- Class restriction- Religion restriction- Rank restriction (for both posting and reading)Immortals that are of rank Sage or higher will be allowedto add/remove groups as well as change restrictions (assumingthe existing restriction is not higher than their rank). Itis not possible to create a board w/o first creating thegroup with the 'news' command.So, now that I have this out of the way, I have a coupletough questions for us all to mull over:- Is there anything else you'd like to see?	- i.e. Are there options missing?- Since we will have 3 groups for things like 'magic' alone, making  that many boards in multiple places around the world is  kinda tedious and error-prone. Should we even have boards  anymore and instead just put a restriction on where players  can use 'news' (like you town's post office)?- Should players be allowed to use the \"Notify me when a new post is  made while I'm logged in\" option since they may be in the middle of  a jungle when it happens? Depends on how OOC we want to allow  the news system.Below are the initial list of newsgroups I've come up with:==Proposed Newsgroups==news.announcements (only Imm+ can post)news.newbienews.imm (angel+ only)news.sage (sage+ only)news.arch (arch+ only)news.admin (admin only)oocmagic.announcements (only SPELLS & Secure+ can post)magic.generalmagic.ideasideas (anything but magic ideas)humourtown.haven (only for members of that town)town.jidooretc etcreligion.saahagoth (only for the faithful...)religion.kylinreligion.magildanetc etc== These will come once we get guilds going again ==guild.havenmage (only for guild members)guild.jidoormageetc etc-------Please make sure to give me your input via this boardso we can get a healthy discussion going.
