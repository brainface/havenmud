Story "You'd be surprised at the amount of garbage that gets left behind when the ships pull in to port and travelers, crew and rats pour out into seaside towns. After much wenching, shenanigans and binge drinking, the rowdy sailors return to ready the vessels once more for the sea, or so I'm told. On one such day an old captain returned to find a very small girl child sitting in a mop bucket on deck of his ship, (pleased as punch with herself and her grimy, mop-water soaked clothes) cheerfully belting out one of the more crass sea shanties the sailors are so very fond of. (After a futile yet frantic search for anyone who would claim her as their own) the girl child was taken in by the motley crew of ruffians, her boisterous song (and occasional jaunty jig) the coin for her board and bread for these many years. (And while she could pass for a right lady if cleaned up properly) she is often found jabbing the mainsail or hoisting the jib or whatever it is those seafaring types do, dirty as you please, her lilting voice carrying her spirited songs across the vast waters... At least that's what I heard."
