Students will also be provided with locations of merchant harbors and known areas of pirate activity, as well as how to defend themselves from such.Costs for training are open to negotiation, but in general will entail an equal share of all sailing profits, especially when I or another trainer accompany a student on a voyage.Applicants should address all inquiries to Captain Fortunado of Parva, in person or by mail.","read":({"fortunado","duuk","katerina","alessia","yorin","alessandra","kilak","radimir","melchezidek","hekate","gnaeus","dondar","abracadabris","ohtar","adelmere","tavi","aleph","slush","throlasyr","artanis","mahkefel","vadox","sarin","sigmar","tanov","tavren","zoron","zoren","alan","zeradan","yezzin","zaxon","casmin","rayzor","zargon","zim","caterine","irtheyus","itkupaju","kalev","luciole","borsch","vieve","malvo","sunerose","redhaven","nephele","torak","relg","kuahrin","reythirren","bartolo","urien","atrus","torawakamaru","eilonwy","rozenn","shadorn","naz","leonaveri","celene","marroc","mysra","malia","victis","juilet","tyr","saorise","zeratul","ferro","moor","merridale","sceir","faustino","felyncice","hiro","gratian","blood","hithaeron","rapax","liskan","fluffy","wes","zalbar","tinny","lifeng","darur","devlin","amelie","shademaster","sacris","bjarke","ronan","shigi","demandred","jaques","malitiae",}),"subject":"nautical institute of parva opens",]),(["time":1251162718,"author":"yorin","post":"I am interested in purchasing your services.
