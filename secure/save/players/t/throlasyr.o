Story "Born to a human woman, who waited tables at Rupert's Hole, and a male elf I will never meet. My mother told me he was a great elf who stood for everything good and just. When I was ten, she finally told me my father's name, Archduke Caranthir. I was so proud that day and I told all my friends. That is when I learned the true. My friends told me about how Duuk punished him for crimes that were heinous to mention.  I ran to his estate and sat there crying. I went there every day just sitting in the dark talk to myself asking why our Lord killed my father.  Several days later I heard someone answer me. The voice told me to seek out the cleric in the bandit camp. I would sneak out of Haven and meet with the cleric in camp. The cleric open my mind and heart to Taigis. He told me if my father served Taigis he would never have been killed. When I was old enough the cleric made me an Initate of the Fallen God."
