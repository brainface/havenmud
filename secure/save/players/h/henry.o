Story "Our story begins with %^YELLOW%^Henry Hudsonfoot Stinktoe the First%^RESET%^. He was a decent Halfling until one day, while having a picnic in the park. He and his lady friend where celebrating their engagement with honey goat cheese and spumante chapagne, a dirty old halfling gypsy beggar began her barrage of begging for basics. When he could take no more he reprimanded the woman in his Halfling way, standing as tall as he could and telling her what he thought about her as a halfling being as well as he could. Jinxed by the gypsy, he went wildly mad and was never seen again. Little did he know, the future-misses-Stinktoe would have a baby boy. %^YELLOW%^Stinktoe the Second%^RESET%^, wary of keeping his father's reputation about his person, strived to work hard but the gypsy's curse struck his life, the same time it struck the father's. His business failed, his wife gone with children, he was driven to drink and eventually drowned in a bog. %^YELLOW%^Stinktoe the Third%^RESET%^ scoffed at the idea of a gypsy curse throughout his life. During his birthday, with his family and the whole town there, he thought he would be safe. The celebration was a festival, a carnival of halflings. He met a girl and found love on the lake but did not know the girl's past and she spiked his drink with halfling drugs! Shortly thereafter he was terrified by the topiary and fell down a well. %^YELLOW%^Henry Hudsonfoot Stinktoe the Fourth%^RESET%^ has been terrified from age of knowing his family history until this very moment. He began studying magical shields. Obsessed with being able to prevent any harm to his person he has worked long hours in libraries across Kailie. Shields are the only thing keeping him from the curse of his great-grandfather. He travels the world, seeking as much and as powerful information he can, boosting his defenses for the time when he can either break the curse, or it breaks him."
