Story "Born to elven parents in a small cottage on the outskirts of Haven Town, Ainent Canere is the son of Ain and Emmta Canere. His parents chose him name as a simplified contraction of their combined names. Ain came from a long line of musicians, but, much to his parents' disappointment chose the life of a farmer instead. He married Emmta at age 17, when she was 19. Ainent was the second of their three children, but the first son. When he decided to join the ranks of the bards, his grandparents on his father Ain's side were ecstatic. Ever since, whenever he plays any music he does so with fond memories of his grandfather."
