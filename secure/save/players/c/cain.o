Story "Born into a lowly family within the walls of Malveillant, Cain was forced to grow quickly. Day after day he had to search and fight just to eat. As he fought daily for food he quickly realized that more then the joy of eating the food once the fight ended he was simply enjoying the fight itself, win or lose. One day he insisted that his father come see him in combat for the first time just so deminstrate his talent to him. After the fight his father was so impressed he talked his son into entering his name into a tournament held by Xavien, the best fighter in all of Malveillant. During this tournament he impressed everyone that attended. They were amazed that at such a young age someone could be so fast and strongcombined. Although he lost in the final round his family was proud of him. Cain did so well  that Xavien offered to take him in and teach him everything he did wrong so that next time he will not lose. From that day forward Cain join the power of Malveillant, the fighters!"
